In small groups and then as a class, you will discuss Shook and Fazio (2008). This discussion will get us thinking about the ways that racial/ethnicity data is used in psychological research. In this discussion we will also consider the ethical issues surrounding the use of race/ethnicity data in data science more generally.\n\nFirst, you will work in small groups (groups of ~4). Using the classroom boards, bullet-point your answers to the following three questions pertaining to the article:\n\nWhat did they find?\nHow did they do it?\nWhat is missing or limited?\n\nNext, we will come back together as a group to discuss your answers to these questions. Our discussion of the limitations of this research study will support our discussion about broader issues with the coding and using of race/ethnicity data.\nAfter this initial article discussion, you will work in pairs to try coding raw racial/ethnic identity data. This data comes in both in check-all-that-apply and free response formats. Your task is to create a new categorical variable in the dataset called race_clean. Next, you will discuss in small groups (~4) the choice you made while creating your clean race variable and any thoughts/feelings you had during the task (that you are comfortable sharing with your partner/group)."

    "text": "Activity description\nStudents must come to class having read Shook and Fazio (2008). The following is a suggested timeline for a 70-minute class session.\n\n(15 minutes): Break the class into four groups. Each group will discuss the following questions pertaining to the assigned article and write their bulletpointed responses on the boards. The first two questions help the students warm up and make sure that everyone understood\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nDiscuss the results resented in the article.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nDiscuss the methods employed by the researchers.\n\nWhat is missing or limited?\n\nDiscuss the limitations of the research study. This piece is where the concerns regarding race are likely to come out.\n\n\nBonus (completed if groups finish early): Make a sketch of the dataset that was used in these analyses. What does each row represent? What variables must it have? What index variables must it have?\n\n(25 minutes): Discuss the three questions as a class. Try to move them quickly through the first two questions to leave about half the time for the third question. I would leave them in suspence with the bonus task—perhaps start the following class with this as a warm-up activity. As they raise missing pieces and limitations, write their suggestions on the board in a joint class bulletpointed list.\n\n(15 minutes): Now in pairs, have students start cleaning the messy race data provided. Their task is to code the check-all-that-apply and/or free response data into a new categorical variable called race_clean.\n(10 minutes): Back in small groups of four (two pairs), have students discuss the choices they made and feelings they had while re-coding the race/ethnicity data. These feelings reflect the hard realities that researchers must confront in their work.\n(5 minutes): Wrap up. Let students know that this is not the end of the discussion. If they are feeling like they have more questions than answers, or they are more confused about race and ethnicity in data science than when the class began, this is a good thing—it is a complex issue! You might also remind them that the coding of race and ethnicity in the US is deeply connected to a history of racial oppression. As future data scientists, they can play an active role in creating ethical guidelines for moving towards more appropriate use of race and ethnicity data. It is very important not to skip the wrap up for this activity. Set a timer such that you can touch base with them and ideally, end on a hopeful note."

She taught statistics and computer science at Macalester College before moving to Brown.\nR. Jordan Crouser ’08 was hired as a tenure-track professor of computer science. While we are sad to lose Jordan to CSC, we are ecstatic that he will be staying at Smith and will do everything we can to keep him involved in our program!\nFilling a two-year Visiting Assistant Professor, MassMutual Faculty Fellow position is Lu Lu. Lu is a mathematical statistician with an interest in industrial applications who is coming to Smith from Colby College. Amelia McNamara remains in her MassMutual Faculty Fellow position.\nBen Capistrant was hired as a Visiting Professor. Ben was most recently in the Epidemiology department of the University of Minnesota.\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI’ve got two pieces of big news to report this year (in no particular order):\n\nMy second book, Modern Data Science with R was published by CRC Press. This book was co-authored with Nick Horton and Danny Kaplan, and serves as a textbook for undergraduate data science courses like the ones that I have been teaching here at Smith. The material for the book evolved out of lectures notes and homework assignments that have been used in 292 and 192.\nMy second daughter, Arlo, was born in January. Here is a recent picture of her with Alice.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you at JSM and WSDS!\n\n\nBen Capistrant\nBen Capistrant is a new Visiting Assistant Professor in SDS. His research focuses on social determinants of population health, both in the U.S. and in low and middle-income countries. This summer, he is working on a number of research studies on how providing care to a family member is associated with changes in the caregiver’s health. In June, he started a new project with the Minnesota Department of Human Services to model projections of population aging, health and health care demands in the coming decades. He is glad to use summer conferences as a way to see friends and family around the country and is looking forward to teaching this fall.\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\nThis summer 9 SURF students joined Jordan Crouser in the Human Computation and Visualization Laboratory. The HCV lab produced several papers this year, including:\n\nR. Jordan Crouser, Lyndsey Franklin, Alex Endert, and Kris Cook. Toward theoretical techniques for measuring the use of human effort in visual analytic systems. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(1):121–130, 2017.\nR. Jordan Crouser, Lyndsey Franklin, and Kris Cook. Rethinking visual analytics for streaming data applications.

She taught SDS 201, Statistical Methods for Undergraduate Research, and also Research Methods and the Psychology of Women and Gender in the Psychology department. She also taught a special studies with Minji Kang ’19, on Longitudinal Data Analysis with Structural Equation Modeling. Minji presented analyses conducted for this course at the Modern Modeling Methods (MMM) conference at UConn in May. This Spring Randi also started a project with Connie Zhang ’19, on using R Markdown to create APA style manuscripts. Connie was awarded a SURF to continuing this work at Smith into the summer. With the help of six students, data collection is underway in Randi’s Intergroup Relationships Laboratory on a project examining interpersonal objectification. This year Randi published research articles in the Journal of Family Psychology, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, and Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. This summer she has presented work MMM, the Association for Psychological Science, The European Association of Social Psychology, and taught two data analysis workshops.\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nKatherine is on sabbatical during the 2017–2018 academic year.\n\n\nLu Lu\nI’m excited to begin my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor in Statistical and Data Sciences Program. I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in applied mathematics from University of Connecticut. Since then, I’ve taught at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Colby College.\nI have been working on statistical learning theory, in particular, nonparametric curve estimation and the probability theory related to it. I have studied the aysmptotic properties of density estimators. I’ve become more interested in applying big data analytics to finance. Currently I’m working on credit scoring using survival analysis and other machine learning techniques.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\nIt was fun to reprise my Introduction to Probability and Statistics and Multiple Regression courses last year, but I am looking forward to expanding my course offerings this year. I’ll be taking over Jordan Crouser’s Communicating with Data course in the fall, and creating a Data Journalism course for the spring. My personal goal for the SDS program is for us to have connections with every division on campus, and I’m particularly interested in crossover with the humanities. After a crazy summer of travel last year, I did my best to stay put this summer, which has allowed me to focus more on my research.\n\n\nMiles Ott\nMiles Ott is a new faculty member joining SDS in the Fall. He is interested in the statistical analysis of social network data and public health. This summer he gave a talk titled “Strategic Players for Identifying Optimal Social Network Intervention Subjects, with Application to an Undergraduate Social Network” at the Sunbelt Social Network conference in Beijing. He is excited to be a part of the SDS program and is looking forward to teaching 220 in September, and involving Smith students in his research. In the meantime, he has been sampling delicious baked goods throughout the Pioneer Valley and exploring the rail trail by bike."

I am excited to be teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses in a liberal arts setting. I think New College has a unique master’s program in Data Science. I would be happy to talk to any Smithies who are interested. I will not be able to attend JSM this year due to move but I am hoping to meet Smithies at Women in Statistics and Data Science conference in October. This year, I also have been involved with R Ladies which is a global organization that aims to improve gender diversity in the R community. I started a local chapter in Columbus and hoping to start one in Sarasota. Feel free to contact me if you need help finding/starting a local chapter in your own city.\nMaja Miloslavjevic ’14: I moved to Seattle 5 months ago and now work at Microsoft as a Program Manager in Office365! I love the quick-paced nature of Microsoft and that I get to drive direct customer impact with my work. Outside of work, I spend my time trying to enjoy as much of the Seattle summer as possible before the months of rain begin again…\nJingyang (Judy) Zhang ’14: I am still working for ITS at Smith, currently working on the college’s website.\nSara Stoudt ’15: I made it through year two in the Statistics PhD program at UC Berkeley and finished the Data Sciences for the 21st Century: Environment and Society program. I am currently back at NIST for the summer working on greenhouse gas monitoring data collected via small aircraft. In the fall I will be focusing on helping to teach a new class on writing for statistics and transitioning to research with a project to try to use citizen science data to better understand species distribution changes over space and time.\nLiz Stuart ’97 is a Professor of Mental Health, Biostatistics, and Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She won the 2017 Gertrude Cox Award, given out by the Washington Statistical Society and RTI to recognize an early to mid-career statistician who has made significant contributions to applied statistics. She welcomes anyone who wants to learn about biostatistics, public health, or education to reach out! estuart@jhu.edu\nDana Udwin ’14: is starting the PhD program in biostatistics at Brown University in the fall!\nLizzy (Atkins) Offermann ’15: I recently moved to the Department of Neuropsychology at The Kennedy Krieger Institute / Johns Hopkins. I manage all of the data for the Department and am working with Python, R Studio, SQL, STATA, and SPSS everyday. I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of switching between languages and so appreciate that I still have my notes from Smith in addition to Google :) Each day, I am working on large clinical data sets for manuscript preparation in hopes of targeting our neuropsychological treatments to better serve our patients. In December, I was selected as the Smith Alumnae Admissions Coordinator for Maryland and Delaware - which means I coordinate all student interviews, lead a team of admissions volunteers, and host all of our accepted and admitted student parties. It is a packed job, but I love every moment of it!\nChrista Chiao ’15: I recently started working at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a Regional Targeting Director for the 2018 mid-term elections. I am really excited to combine my statistics and coding skills with some political know-how. The technical skills I’m using most in this job are R, SQL, Bash, GIS, and Python. Last year, I worked as a Deputy Analytics Director in Ohio for the Hillary campaign and as an Analytics Fellow at the Analyst Institute, a political analytics firm that helps campaigns measure the impact of their voter-contact programs. In my spare time, I row with Potomac Boat Club and think about acquiring some hobbies. I am so incredibly envious of the students that get to take part in this Data Science major! If anyone wants to learn more about getting into the (strictly) progressive data world, please let me know."

    "section": "Document won’t knit",
    "text": "Document won’t knit\nThere could be many reasons for this. Usually, the error message will pinpoint the location of the problem. Read the error messages!!\nSome most common problems are:\n\nincluding output in your code chunks, like\n\n\nmean(~speed, data = cars) 169.683\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:1:27: unexpected numeric constant\n1: mean(~speed, data = cars) 169.683\n                              ^\n\n\n\nincluding the &gt; or + prompts that come from the console in your code chunks, like\n\n\n&gt; mean(~speed, data = cars)\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:1:1: unexpected '&gt;'\n1: &gt;\n    ^\n\n\nor\n\ncars %&gt;%\n+ filter(speed &gt; 100)\n\nError: object 'speed' not found\n\n\n\nAsking R to print out an entire data set. This one is often tricky to spot, because the code will work fine in the console, saying something like [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 18684 rows ], but in the RMarkdown it will try to include everything and then run out of memory. The easiest way to spot this is if you have included\n\n\n  cars\n\nin your document, but also dplyr expressions that aren’t saved into an object can do it, like\n\n  cars %&gt;%\n   filter(speed &gt; 100)\n\n\nNot including all the packages you need for your code. This error will occur if you try to use a function in a package that you haven’t loaded previously in your Markdown document.\n\n\nnow()\n\n[1] \"2023-06-26 21:06:05 UTC\"\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nnow()\n\n[1] \"2023-06-26 21:06:05 UTC\"\n\n\nFor SDS classes, you often need to include\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nNote that tidyverse in turn loads dplyr and ggplot2.\nNote also that require() and library() are equivalent for our purposes, but library() is preferred.\n\nPackages not installed. If you try to load a package that is not available in your R session, then you will get a warning.\n\n\nlibrary(imadethisup)\n\nError in library(imadethisup): there is no package called 'imadethisup'\n\n\nTo install the package, click on the “Install” button under the “Packages” tab, or use the install.packages() function.\n\ninstall.packages(\"imadethisup\")\n\n\nHaving spaces or other non-safe characters in filenames. This will often break when you try to compile your Markown document into HTML. Do not use spaces, slashes, or pound signs in filenames!!\nReferring to objects that don’t exist. Recall that your Markdown document knits in a clean R session!! Objects in your working environment are shown under the “Environment” tab in your RStudio window. However, when you knit your Markdown document, it launches in a new, completely different R session. In order to objects to be available in that session, you have to create them. If you see an error like:\n\n\nmy_object\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_object' not found\n\n\nit means that R cannot find any object in its environment called my_object. Make sure that my_object is created in the Markdown document prior to where you are trying to access it.\nOne common way this can occur is if you failed to load a data frame provided by a package (that doesn’t use lazy loading). For example, the oilabs package does not support lazy loading, so you have to use the data() command to bring the data frames into your environment before using them.\n\nlibrary(oilabs)\nhead(ames)\ndata(ames)\nhead(ames)\n\n\nIncorrect file path. Note that absolute filenames like\n\n\nread.csv(\"/home/bbaumer/sds220/data/my_data.csv\")\n\nWarning in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open file\n'/home/bbaumer/sds220/data/my_data.csv': No such file or directory\n\n\nError in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n\n\nwill not work on anyone else’s computer. It is usually better to use a relative file path like:\n\nread.csv(\"~/sds220/data/my_data.csv\")\n\nHowever this will only works if someone else has the same directory structure as you. Note also that the working directory of the R session in which your Markdown document knits is not necessarily the same as the working directory of the R session which you see in RStudio. Thus, if\n\nread.csv(\"my_data.csv\")\n\ndoesn’t work, you may have to try\n\nread.csv(\"project/my_data.csv\")\n\nor something along those lines."

Kim and Johanna Hardin’s Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education paper:\n“Playing the whole game”: A data collection and analysis exercise with Google Calendar.\nAbstract: We provide a computational exercise suitable for early introduction in an undergraduate statistics or data science course that allows students to ‘play the whole game’ of data science: performing both data collection and data analysis. While many teaching resources exist for data analysis, such resources are not as abundant for data collection given the inherent difficulty of the task. Our proposed exercise centers around student use of Google Calendar to collect data with the goal of answering the question ‘How do I spend my time?’ On the one hand, the exercise involves answering a question with near universal appeal, but on the other hand, the data collection mechanism is not beyond the reach of a typical undergraduate student. A further benefit of the exercise is that it provides an opportunity for discussions on ethical questions and considerations that data providers and data analysts face in today’s age of large-scale internet-based data collection."

How does their work impact Prof. Kim’s situation?\n\nAnonymization and differential privacy\n\nWhat role do data anonymization and differential privacy play in Prof. Kim’s situation? Could these techniques lead to a safer product?\n\nTerms of Service\n\nHow closely do the ethical issues track the legal issues?

We are fighting for racial justice, asking ourselves tough questions about privilege, racism, and white supremacy, and making moves towards a more just future (still). Among the year’s many highlights, perhaps the most enduring will be the successful effort by Miles Ott ’01 to petition the ASA to rename the Fisher Award (one of the most prestigious in all of statistics). R.A. Fisher was a virulent eugenicist, but thanks in part to Miles’s leadership, his award has been officially retired.\nThis newsletter is mostly a distillation of our Twitter @SmithCollegeSDS feed.

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nSome big changes occurred on the faculty side:\n\nAfter 31 years of teaching statistics at Smith, Katherine Halvorsen retired. Unfortunately, Katherine’s much-deserved retirement party was postponed due to the pandemic, but we’ll celebrate her once gatherings of more than 30 people are allowed on campus. As you might have expected given Katherine’s work ethic, she is still planning to teach two classes this academic year.\nJenny Smetzer, Dhanamalee Bandara, and David Rockoff have left the College.\nBen Baumer received tenure and promotion to associate professor, and has taken over as SDS chair. Ben is the first faculty member to receive tenure as a member of SDS.\nWe hired Scott LaCombe to a tenure-track position that is joint with the Government department (see below). Wish Scott well, he now has to deal with two different Baumers for department chairs! 😆\nSara Stoudt ’15 finished her PhD at UC-Berkeley and was hired as a Lecturer. Even though Sara technically predates the SDS program, like many of you she is living proof that we are doing something right over here.\n\n\n\nSome news 🗞️: today is my first day as part of the @SmithCollegeSDS team. What a dream!\n\n— Sara Stoudt, PhD (@sastoudt) July 1, 2020\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI’m trying to enjoy all the time at home with my wife and two children. 🤪 Alice is 6, and she can now read, swim, ride a bike, and log in to a Linux terminal. Arlo is 3 and she is an adorable terror. Today I woke up when she jumped on my head (true story).\nLast fall, I taught a new course on advanced programming with R, that was very rewarding for both the students and me. They wrote 11 R packages in three weeks, some of which have already built up a user base and may make it onto CRAN!\nI’m now a tenured associate professor, which is strange and wonderful. I’m working on finishing a 2nd edition of our data science textbook, Modern Data Science with R. This one will have a free online version! This is been a very trying year, but I’m so encouraged by all the incredible work our alums are doing and all the fabulous colleagues I get to work with!\nIt still doesn’t feel real that Sara Stoudt ’15 has finished her PhD and will be working with us (especially since no one meets in person anymore!). Things have truly come full circle for me and I couldn’t be prouder.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis crazy year is divided in half by COVID-19! One highlight for me from the before times is that I took five Smith students to the Women in Statistics and Data Science’s annual conference held this year in Bellevue Washington. Our flight out of Bradley was cancelled due to a plane crash, so we changed our flights to Logan. We then left a wallet in the Valley Transporter van upon arrival at Logan (but got it back!) and then we left a laptop at TSA in route to our gate (but got it back later!). In the end we MADE it! It was a joy to speak on the plenary panel, “Creating and Sustaining Respectful and Inclusive Community” and to attend my first WSDS! In the Fall semester I also taught my research seminar PSY 364: Research seminar in Intergroup Relationships for the second time, and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. It was lovely! During COVID times I’ve picked up several hobbies including gardening, cooking, meditation, reading for pleasure and personal growth, and beginner guitar. This year I’ve published papers in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology and Frontiers in Psychology’s section on Gender, Sex and Sexualities. I’ve also recently submitted a paper investigating daily instagram use and women’s self-objectification for publication in a psychology journal.\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nLast fall I returned from teaching at Middlebury College in 2018–19 to teach at Smith again. September was a challenging month. I plunged back into Smith advising, committee work, and teaching Probability and Categorical Data Analysis. I became the Honors Chair for Math and Stat. I served as honors advisor to Crystal Zang ’20 in SDS and as a reader for Aoi Ogawa ’20’s thesis in SDS. I visited Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, as a member of their visiting committee for the Math and Stat Department, and I continue to serve on the Board of Directors for the American Statistical Association and on the ASA’s Council of Sections Governing Board. In the beginning of the spring term my husband and I enjoyed several Smith basketball home games. After spring break and during the move to online teaching we have turned to jigsaw puzzles for amusement and long walks. My big news is that I have retired after 31 years teaching at Smith. I knew I would miss you all and thus I’ve signed up to teach part-time next year: Probability in the fall and Math Stat in the spring.\n\n\nWill Hopper\nI’m excited to start my first full year at Smith, and keep doing what I do best: introducing students to their new favorite subject, statistics! I’ll be teaching SDS 201, which introduces people to the wonderful world of statistical modeling, as well as SDS 291, which goes more into depth with Multiple Regression, and introduces people to an even wider family of statistical models. Thanks to teaching remotely, I’ve revived my video production and editing skills that have lied dormant since undergraduate film classes. Despite the circumstances, I’ve had a lot of fun making silly thumbnails and pretending I’m a YouTuber.\nWhen I’m not thinking about how to explain the nuances of a two-tailed hypothesis test, I love playing competetive Pokémon, specifically the VGC format. I’ve been playing with Ashton Cox’s Pincurchin/Raichu Team recently, which has absolutely tanked my ranking, but it’s all in good fun. Come to office hours if you want to team-build with me!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nWhat a bonkers 2019-2020 it has been! We’ll be telling our grandchildren’s generation about it for sure! This past year I taught, both in-person and remotely, SDS 220 Intro Stats twice, SDS 192 Intro to Data Science, as well as SDS’s revamped SDS 293 Modeling for Machine Learning. Some highlights of this past year:\n\nI was honoured with the 2020 Faculty Teaching Award from the Smith College Student Government Association for outstanding dedication to teaching! Thanks Smithies!\nIn September, I accompanied four Smithies to StatFest 2019 at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston TX. StatFest is a one-day ASA conference aimed at encouraging undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups to consider careers and graduate studies in the statistical sciences.\nThe print edition of my Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse textbook was published by CRC Press.\nMy first foray into forest ecology research was published by the Public Library of Science journal PLOS One: A permutation test and spatial cross-validation approach to assess models of interspecific competition between trees. Try saying that title three times fast!\n\nLastly, my normal self-care routines took a big hit from the shoulder surgery I had in December as well as the pandemic. Some new outlets for well-being I’ve discovered as a result include: sensory deprivation epsom salt-water floats, TRX suspension training, spinning, going on long walks, and gardening. Although a family of deer are constantly eating all my crops 🦌🦌🦌🌿!\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nIt’s almost strange to think that our last newsletter was just a year ago! My second year at Smith included teaching new courses, attending conferences, submitting research papers for review, bringing collaborators to Smith, and knitting (both Rmd files and actual yarn). A few highlights from this year, include:\n\nJourneying to International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference in the Netherlands with seven Smithies in November. They opened the main conference presenting their peer-reviewed paper and then spent the rest of the week discussing music, computer science, and video games with leading experts in the field. They were constantly mistaken for graduate students, which was really cool.\nCo-Organizing the Women in MIR workshop (that four Smithies attended!) and attending the Women in Machine Learning workshop in 2019\nBeing part of the Kahn Project TranslationS and worked on my book proposal with my collaborator Prof. John Laudun. Prof. Laudun was also able to visit Smith, where we shared our work at the Liberal Arts Lunch.\nSupervising Jessica Keast ’20’s SDS thesis. It was a great project, and it was an absolute highlight of my year to see her present her work (over Zoom) to an audience that included SDS majors, MIR experts, and faculty as well as her friends and family. Jessica also won the annual SDS Research Prize for her collection of research conducted at Smith, including her thesis and work on the ISMIR paper.\n\nThere’s lots to be excited about for next year, including our amazing new SDS colleagues Will Hopper, Scott LaCombe, and Sara Stoudt ’15! Looking forward to working with all of them!\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nScott LaCombe is joining Smith College this Fall with a joint appointment in Statistical and Data Sciences and Government. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa and will be living in New England for the first time. Scott’s focus is leveraging data to better understand how public opinion is translated into state policies, and what networks states have formed when developing policy solutions. He is very excited to be teaching in the Fall and exploring the Pioneer Valley.\n\n\nMiles Ott\nWhat a year! Before everything got locked down I traveled to Santiago, Chile to work with my collaborator Isabelle Beaudry, to Irvine to work with Alicia Johnson and Smith Alum Mine Dogucu ’09 on our forthcoming textbook Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R, and to Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine to talk about my research in respondent driven sampling. This year I taught Intro Stats in the fall, and for the first time I taught the SDS Capstone course in the spring. My first SDS major advisees graduated, and I am so proud of all of them! I joined the development committee of the American Statistical Association, and am excited to learn more about the ASA as an organization. I am delighted to be working with new SDS colleagues Will Hopper, Scott LaCombe, and Sara Stoudt ’15! Special message to alums: I love hearing/reading your updates!\n\n\nSara Stoudt\nI’m excited to jump up to this part of the newsletter this year. :) I finished my PhD in statistics at UC Berkeley this summer and am joining the SDS program as a lecturer for the year. I’m looking forward to teaching Communicating with Data and intro stats (and being back in Herrell’s territory).\nSince the last newsletter I had an amazing summer at the LA Times, I wrote my dissertation (“A Statistical Investigation of Species Distribution Models and Communication of Statistics Across Disciplines”), Deb Nolan and I submitted our “Communicating with Data” book, and I picked up some other fun projects along the way."

    "text": "Faculty Updates\n\nRandi Garcia was promoted to associate professor with tenure!\nFatou Sanogo got a tenure-track job at Bates! We’re wishing Fatou all the best in her next steps.\nWe hired Kaitlyn Cook as a tenure-track assistant professor. Kaitlyn is a biostatistician coming from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where she completed her doctorate and a postdoc. Her research focuses on methodological development for cluster-correlated and interval-censored data, with a particular emphasis on applications to cluster-randomized HIV (or other infectious disease) prevention studies. Kaitlyn will be teaching a range of statistics courses and may choose to join the steering committee for the new interdepartmental major in Mathematical Statistics (MST).\nWe hired Shiya Cao as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistical and data sciences. Shiya comes to us from WPI, where she completed her PhD in Information Technology. Her research focuses on disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics. Shiya will be teaching SDS 192 and SDS 100 in her first year.\nWe hired Jared Joseph as a visiting assistant professor for the next two years. Jared just completed his PhD in sociology at UC-Davis. His research uses computational techniques and civic data to uncover patterns of behavior that are otherwise unseen. For example, political networks of prohibition gangsters and bias hidden in the text of academic recruitment. Jared will be teaching SDS 192 an application domain course in his first year.\nWe’ll be searching for two tenure-track positions this year, both of which are joint with other departments!\n\na joint position with the Mathematical Sciences department for a mathematical statistician\n\na joint position with the Physics department for a computational physicist\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nThis past year was transitional for me and the department. We’ve brought on a number of outstanding junior faculty members, while also tenuring Randi Garcia! We now have a plan of succession, as Randi has been elected the future Chair of SDS, to start July 2023, when I leave for a full-year sabbatical.\nThis year I continued to oversee the DSC-WAV project, which is now entering its final year. We published two papers related to this work, a short one in the Harvard Data Science Review and a longer one in Foundations of Data Science. AS part of these efforts I’m working on creating transfer pathways in data science from two-year to four-year colleges in Massachusetts. My collaborators and I also published our thoughts on the tidyverse.\nI’m excited to begin the new year with new colleagues!\n\n\nShiya Cao\nThis year’s keywords for me included new and transition. As a newly minted Ph.D., I am looking forward to continuing to conduct disability inclusion and broader social inclusion research and engaging Smithies in these research projects. My doctoral dissertation focused on the critical view of the design of information systems to improve the workplace accommodation process for disabled employees. An initial version was co-published at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in 2022. I also conducted digital accessibility research regarding data-based decision making to integrate accessibility guidelines into college curricula, which was co-published at Behavior & Information Technology in 2021. I also have a forthcoming coauthored book chapter titled “The Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations”. I am excited to further explore these research areas with Smithies and help them pay attention to human, social, and emotional elements of data science.\nI also can’t wait to start teaching at Smith! I will be teaching SDS 192 and SDS 100 this Fall. I taught an Introduction to Data Science course at WPI for five terms and developed course content including statistics lectures, data visualization labs, programming and machine learning tutorials, assignments, and quizzes. However, there are still things for me to learn with new materials, new platforms, new tools, and new students. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to evolve my teaching strategies, ideas, and philosophies as I grow alongside my students.\nAnother new thing for me is that I have moved from Central MA to Western MA. This is the first time I have lived in the countryside. I love nature and seeing so much green. However, again, I have many new things to learn, such as gardening, living in harmony with bears. Life is full of adventure. Keep learning, keep improving. I am excited to start my new journey here with great colleagues and great students.\n\n\nKaitlyn Cook\nI’m incredibly honored and excited to be joining the Statistics and Data Science Program at Smith! I’m coming to Northampton by way of Boston, MA, where I’ve lived for the last seven years: first as a biostatistics graduate student at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and then as a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. My research focuses on statistical methods development for clinical trials with (a) cluster randomization schemes, wherein entire groups of individuals (such as families, schools, or communities) are collectively assigned to a particular treatment arm, and (b) time-to-event endpoints, where a “time-to-event” endpoint might be something like the time from study enrollment to COVID-19 infection or the time to progression from HIV to AIDS. I published a paper on this topic in Biometrics this past August (a preprint is available here for those who are interested!) and have spent the last year working on both a pediatric sleep medicine trial and a COVID-19 treatment/prevention trial. I’m looking forward to continuing this research while at Smith, as well as to teaching Probability (MTH 246) and Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220) this fall!\nOutside of the classroom, I dedicate myself to watching (too much) reality TV—this past winter I managed to watch all 19 seasons of Top Chef over the course of two and a half months, though sadly without any noticeable improvement in my own culinary skills—and am also an avid reader, an avid Zumba-er, and a sometimes runner.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis past Fall semester marked a returned to the classroom! I cannot express how good it felt to get back in there and see all of my students faces (well, half of their faces). Although masking and still being very much in a global pandemic came with challenges, just being in the same room with everyone was amazing. In SDS 290 Design and Analysis I switched textbooks and continued having students design their own individual experiments—an assignment I adopted for remote teaching which I’m happy to have carried over into the in-person course. I also taught (a full semester of) SDS 291 Multiple Regression for the first time! It was nice to get to know this smaller group of students of the course of the semester. My research group continued working on the daily-diary data investigating household and childcare labor among cohabitating couples.\nIn the Spring semester I worked with a great group of students on the DSC-WAV project. They continued work started by a group at Amherst College creating an equity dashboard for the SPIFFY coallition. My research group analyzed data on a project investigating self-objectification and Zoom use. We hope to submit this research report for publication this summer. I am honored to have received the 2022 Mu Sigma Rho Early Career Undergraduate Impact Award! This award is very meaningful to me as recognition of my work mentoring students in SDS over the years.\nThe Spring semester also brought two very important pieces of great news for me: 1) I received tenure, and 2) I learned that I’m expecting a baby a September!! I feel so honored to become a permanent member of the faculty at an institution I love. Stay tuned for news on the baby in next year’s newsletter.\n\n\nWill Hopper\n\n\nJared Joseph\nThis Fall will bring many exciting changes for me as I start my first year at Smith. I’m moving from the West to East coast, progressing from student to professor, and shifting titles from sociologist to data scientist. I see each of these changes as an opportunity to bring the best of my experiences to a new venue.\nBridging the gap between the social and data sciences has always been a passion of mine, and I look forward to continuing to do so in my instruction. As I prepare to teach Introduction to Data Science (SDS 192), I look forward to highlighting the human element in the data we use, and hopefully inviting more social scientists to level up their data skills. As a recent student in the social sciences, I can remember the initial hurdles of reaching beyond my comfort zone, but can also speak to the major ways it has improved my work, and my life in general. As I prepare for this work, I hope to learn more about my new home, as it’s my first time living in this part of the world.\nIn addition to my teaching, I’ll be focusing on translating my dissertation into publications. I studied how asset forfeiture (basically police seizing private property) is used in California over the past two decades, and the impact such power has on law enforcement actions. I recently got the news that the first paper from this project has been accepted for publication (more details soon). I’ve got 2 more papers planned from this project! For now I get to enjoy the most fun part of the research process (in my opinion), deciding what my next big question will be.\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello SDS world! A lot has been going! First, my forest ecology research started to take off. On top of continuing my work with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal VA, I’ve started new collaborations with Harvard Forest in nearby Petersham MA. My collaborators and I have been putting the finishing touches on two big papers about this work, standby! Second, in Fall 2022, SDS 192 Intro to Data Science had a whopping 121 students registered; by far the largest number of students I’ve had! While having this many students presented many new challenges, it was still a rewarding experience; having the Spinelli tutoring center provide both in-class data assistants and evening drop-in tutoring made this possible. Next, I also very much enjoyed acting as the faculty liaison to the SDS Coalition of Color, who this past academic year got officially chartered as an SGA organization. Lastly, but most importantly, my wife and I welcomed the birth of our first child, Georgina “Gigi” Jeewon Kim! Baby Gigi’s interests include making deep baritone burps and listening to baby lullaby renditions of Guns n’ Roses songs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nSeason three of the pandemic was another year like no other. It was great to be back on campus with students chatting about statistics and machine learning. This past fall, I was a co-organizer for the Teaching ML workshop which included a talk by Prof. Alicia Johnson, collaborator and co-author of Miles Ott ’01. (Our next workshop is in September; join us!) I’ve continued working with students on my collaborative NSF TRIPODS+X grant during the academic year and to work virtually with four students through SURF.\nI’m teaching both Modeling for Machine Learning (SDS 293) and Computational Machine Learning(CSC294) this fall. Then I’ll be on sabbatical in the spring. Looking forward to seeing everyone again this fall!\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nI can’t believe I’m beginning my third year at Smith and was so grateful to be able to see and work with student during the last academic year. I have particularly enjoyed working with students on creating a new database of racial disparities in state-level population health outcomes.\nIn this last year, my co-authored book titled Choosing the Future: Technology and Opportunity in Communities came out, where we explore the political and economic effects of broadband in counties and cities across the United States. I’ve also continued my research on public policy in the American states, and hope to continue working with students to think critically about the data generating process.\nThis upcoming year, I will be teaching two courses for the Government department in the Fall (Gov 200 and GOV 306) and in the Spring will be teaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220) as well as a seminar in Network analysis in Political Science (SDS/GOV 338- which will count towards your application domain!)\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nWhat a whirlwind of a first year at Smith! It has been such a joy and a privilege getting to know Smith students and colleagues, and I can’t wait for what’s in store in the coming years.\nThis year I launched the Data Ethnography and Advocacy Lab - a research group focused on investigating the cultural histories of public interest datasets in the United States. A number of exceptional Smith students have helped get this lab off the ground! Based on this work, I published a paper in the conference proceedings for ACM FAccT. The paper highlights a number of concerns around the representativeness and usefulness of “disclosure datasets,” or datasets aggregated from information produced by the same institutions the data is meant to hold accountable. I also published a book chapter in the Handbook for the Anthropology of Technology, detailing the knowledge practices engaged as the EPA works to develop nationwide vehicle emissions estimates. In March, five Smithies (Amrita Acharya, Sena Amuzu, Lara Brown, Juniper Huang, Naomi Liftman, and Molly Zelloe) came with me down to NYC School of Data to present a workshop to NYC civic technologists and city staff on how to examine and narrate the cultural backstories of datasets. I also brought an anthropologist’s perspective to a panel assessing “20 Years of Data Science” at International Data Week this past June.\nIn the Fall, I’ll be teaching Data and Social Justice (SDS 189) and Introduction to Data Science (SDS 192), and in the Spring, I’ll be teaching Data Ethnography (SDS 237) and Capstone in Statistical & Data Sciences (SDS 410). I hope you’ve soaked up the best of summer, and looking forward to seeing you very soon!"

I’m really enjoying all the learning in my new role, and helping researchers with exciting projects. In my spare time, I enjoy biking around the bay area, going on gorgeous hikes, and spending time with my cat.\nLizzy (Atkins) Offermann ’15: Life has been busy over the last year in the Offermann household! I graduated with my master’s degree in Clinical and Translational Research from George Washington University, changed jobs and now work for an amazing healthcare tech company aiming to make healthcare more accessible for everyone, have continued my work as the Treasurer for the Class of 2015 Cabinet, and recently finished up a busy admissions season as the Smith Club of Baltimore’s Alumnae Admission Coordinator for the tri-state area. Some major professional highlights involve working on all of the data for my company’s COVID-19 Antiviral Treatment Programs across multiple states in the US, our ship-to-home preventative care kit, and most recently our partnership with the CDC and White House to make COVID-19 testing more accessible! My involvement with these three projects and others ranges from data ingestion from the UI, data wrangling, modeling, database creation, analytics, visualization, and working with the customers and stakeholders to fully understand the story their data is telling them. We have open positions on my team and other fabulous teams at Color, so if you are looking to get into healthcare tech - reach out!\nPersonally, our twin toddlers are getting closer and closer to turning 5 years old and entering public school - wild how time flies! My husband and I just love to watch them grow, learn, and form into their own little people with full personalities. We have been very thankful to avoid COVID so far and the kiddos are almost fully vaxxed now, too - fingers crossed we can keep it away until they get their final dose!\nSara Stoudt ’15: My first year as an assistant professor at Bucknell University is in the books, and now I’m gearing up to teach a first-year seminar in the fall on “Storytelling with Data”. Send me your favorite data stories! Here are some things I’m proud of this year: for the birders, for the teachers, and for the creatives."

Thank you Peter for your service to SDS!\nOur search for a joint position with GOV failed last year. Fortunately, we will be searching again this fall. If you know good candidates, please direct them our way!\nAfter four bountiful years, the MassMutual Visiting Assistant Professor positions expired. MassMutual’s support brought us three years of Amelia McNamara, two years of Jordan Crouser and Lu Lu, and one year of David Rockoff, for which we are eternally grateful.\nWe hired Dhanamalee Bandara as a Visiting Assistant Professor for 2019-2020. Dhanamalee comes to us from the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She has a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a Statistics concentration from Texas Tech University, and will be teaching 291 in the fall. Welcome Dhanamalee!\nWe hired David Rockoff as a Visiting Assistant Professor for another year after his MassMutual appointment ended.\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI’m coming up for tenure this fall, and working on my dossier over the summer. I’m also working on a second edition of Modern Data Science with R, which we have converted to R Markdown and will publish simultaneously online and in print, thanks to bookdown. If you come to JSM this year you will have a hard time avoiding me, as I’ll be winning the Waller Education Award from the Section on Statistics Education and the Significant Contributor Award from the Section on Statistics in Sports. Both are great honors and I’m deeply grateful to those of you who supported my nomination!\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\n[Jordan is away for much of this summer and (Ben thinks) will be on sabbatical in the fall.]\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nI just finished my third year at Smith and it’s so exciting to see how much the SDS program has grown since I arrived! This year I got to teach 17 Smith students Structural Equation Modeling in SDS 390. I also continued to expand the client-partner relationships in SDS 290, Research Design and Analysis, teaching the course for a second time in Spring 2019. Thirty-five students in SDS 290 conducted 10 extremely cool experimental studies with the Museum of Art, the Executive Education office, and again with the Botanic Garden. This year I gave two talks about the SDS program, the first at JSM in Vancouver on the many pathways through the SDS major, and in May I spoke at NESS about integrating real-world projects into a modern design course. I also published a book chapter on data analysis strategies for relationship research in an edited volume titled New Directions in the Psychology of Close Relationships. I am proud to receive one of the 2019 the Sherrerd Prizes for distinguished teaching–ceremony upcoming in October 2019. Lastly, I am looking forward to a sabbatical in Spring 2020!\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nI’ve spent the past academic year teaching statistics, Design of Experiments and Categorical Data Analysis, at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. Middlebury is a small, coeducational, liberal arts college with about 2500 students. Middlebury, Vermont, is a small New England town of about 8500 residents chartered in 1761, and located in the Champlain Valley. The area is very rural and has lots of farms for both beef and dairy cattle. It also has several historical sites including the Hubbardton Battlefield where the only battle held in Vermont during the revolutionary war occurred in July of 1777. We also toured the site of the American encampment at Fort Independence, just across the lake from Fort Ticonderoga, both of which were American fortifications during the war and were abandoned shortly before the British sailed down Lake Champlain. One of my happy accomplishments was hiking the TAM, the Trail Around Middlebury, an 18-mile trail that encircles the village of Middlebury. I’m looking forward to being back at Smith in the fall and teaching Design and Categorical again.\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello everyone, I’ve just completed my first year at Smith and I’m thrilled to be calling SDS home. It’s been an eventful year, in particular attending the Women in Statistics & Data Science conference with Prof. Miles Ott and being lead organizer for Five College DataFest. I’m looking forward to year two!\n\n\nKatie Kinnaird\nI can’t believe I’ve completed my first year at Smith; what a whirlwind this year has been! I got to teach four (new to me) courses in two departments, from Communicating with Data to a senior seminar in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The students in MIR having a paper accepted through peer-review to the anniversary track at this year’s International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference in the Netherlands. I am so thrilled by their paper and cannot wait to see them present in November. This year also took me overseas and around the country, attending ISMIR in Paris, the Women In Machine Learning (WiML) Workshop in Montreal, SDSS Conference in Seattle, and giving talks at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and at the College of the Holy Cross. While this year was the beginning of my time at Smith, it also was my last year as President of the WiML Executive Board. Even though my term is over, my commitment to build more inclusive machine learning and MIR communities will continue. I’m so lucky to be part of SDS and am grateful for my amazing colleagues and students!\n\n\nMiles Ott\nSo many wonderful things happened this year! I had fun teaching a class on my research area: Statistical Analysis of Social Network Data, as well as Probability, Mathematical Statistics, and Intro Stats 201. I am continuing to work on Respondent Driven Sampling, LGBT Health, and methods for Social Network Interventions in my research. I am getting a bit more involved in efforts to make Stats and Data Science more inclusive for LGBTQ+ folks. I attended both WSDS and SDSS conferences for the first time, and I thought that they both were excellent, welcoming, and fun. I highly recommend them both! Best of all, I started working with wonderful new colleagues Albert Y. Kim, Katie Kinnaird, Dave Rockoff, and Jenny Smetzer.\n\n\nDavid Rockoff\nI just finished my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Smith, having taught Intro Stats and Communicating With Data. This summer I will give a short course on Survival Analysis for MassMutual. I am very excited to be sticking around for another year, during which I will develop a special topics course in educational measurement.\n\n\nJenny Smetzer\nI just completed my first year as Laboratory Instructor in SDS and Psychology. I love teaching the intro stats labs, and very much look forward to teaching next year! This year I published peer-reviewed research articles in the “The Auk” – a top ornithology journal – and in “Ecological Modeling”, and presented research at the Acadia National Park Science Symposium. This year I also continued an ongoing research collaboration with the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center modeling climate change refugia for species of regional conservation concern. This summer I am traveling to Maine for an intensive science communication training at the Schoodic Institute, and to lead two stakeholder workshops to help conservation managers incorporate climate change refugia data products into management plans. After the whirlwind trip to Maine, I am looking forward to the birth of a new baby boy in early September!"

    "text": "Alumnae Updates\n\nMine Dogucu ’09: I spent the academic year at Denison University as Visiting Assistant Professor of Data Analytics. In July, I will be joining the Department of Statistics at University of California Irvine as Assistant Professor of Teaching. I had many opportunities reconnecting with Smithies. In September, I took my students to Amherst College for StatFest where Portia Exum (Parker) ’10 was a panelist. Emily Dodwell ’11 was also in the Valley to give a talk for the SDS department. In October, I attended Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference in Cincinnati where I met Dr. Miles Ott ’01 (side note: he now is a prof. at Smith, see above for his update in case you missed it). Dr. Alicia Johnson of Macalester College, Dr. Ott, and I now collaborate on a Bayesian Statistics textbook for undergraduate students that is going to be published by CRC. I organized Denison’s first DataFest. In May, I attended my tenth year reunion at Smith. I connected with friends and faculty and met graduating seniors at the SDS reception. I also ran into Dr. Elizabeth Stuart ’97 during Friday Tea in the Cloud. I enjoy (online and offline) connections with Smithies who are in Statistical and Data Sciences and am looking forward to making new ones in the future.\nWencong (Priscilla) Li ’18: I went back to watch the 2019 commencement and was happy to see that the SDS department is growing!\nJordan Menter ’16: In May I finished the last year of the Data Science Development Program at MassMututal, concluding three years of full-time work as a junior data scientist and part-time graduate study in computer science at UMass Amherst. I’m still waiting for my diploma to come in the mail, but in the meantime I’ve accepted a data scientist role at MM. We recently welcomed the sixth cohort of the DSDP - they’re wicked smart, and it’s so exciting to see so much energy and engagement from them.\nThis fall I hope to submit a paper on algorithmic fairness and causality that I worked on as part of my MS degree, supervised by Professor David Jensen at UMass Amherst. I was also lucky enough to take an ethics and computing course last fall, and will be part of a group-level collaboration among myself, Professor Michelle Trim (also at UMass Amherst), and some of my classmates (all of whom were or are also in the DSDP!) to produce a data science and ethics publication of some sorts (a brief textbook, or a reader for a course, or a co-authored paper…). I feel very lucky to have experiences in the research side of things, in addition to the work I do in industry.\nFinally, I’ve greatly enjoyed mentoring current Smith senior and SDS major Starry Zhou ’20. It’s wonderful to have connections back to the department, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for SDS!\nSara Stoudt ’15: I made it through another year in the PhD with (hopefully) only one more to go. This year I became a Berkeley Institute for Data Science Fellow and got to help organize a “Fostering diverse and inclusive data science at Berkeley” series for underrepresented undergraduate students. Professor Deb Nolan and I are are finishing up our book on how to write about data and are hoping to have it out in the spring. I’m spending the summer at the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, living the glamorous data journalist life. :D\nDana Udwin ’14: I passed the qualifying exam! The plan for the summer is to resume research with Professor Crawford and stress a little less."

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nI can say with certainty—which is rare in our discipline—that the 2020–2021 academic year was the most difficult for the faculty in…who knows how long? We all adapted our pedagogy to remote instruction and settled in for the long haul of a year of Zoom meetings and online classes. My heart goes out to Sara Stoudt ’15, who accepted a one-year teaching position and then never got to set foot in her office or in a Smith classroom!\nIt was nevertheless an eventful year for faculty:\n\nMiles Ott ’01 was granted tenure and promotion to associate professor in February. To our great sadness, Miles resigned his position at the end of the year to become a Senior Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson. We wish Miles all the best in his new line of work and will miss him dearly.\nSara Stoudt ’15 accepted a tenure-track position at Bucknell University. We’re thrilled for Sara and look forward to collaborating with her.\nWe hired Lindsay Poirier as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistics and data science. Lindsay is a data anthropologist who comes to us from UC-Davis. We’re super-excited about the breadth of new course offerings she will offer and the experience she brings to the Program.\nWe hired Fatou Sanogo as a Lecturer. Fatou just completed her PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. She’ll be teaching mostly introductory statistics and we are lucky to have her here as she starts her career.\nWe’ll be searching for three tenure-track positions this year!\n\na biostatistician\na 2nd MassMutual assistant professor position\na joint position to be shared with the Mathematics department for a Mathematical Statistician\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nIt was a hard year to be Chair! We never even had the chance to celebrate my tenure decision before the pandemic threw us all into a tailspin. I’m grateful to my family and my colleagues for their perseverance through all the challenges we faced.\nWe finished the 2nd edition of Modern Data Science with R. There are some interesting things starting to come out of the DSC-WAV project, which now entering its 3rd year. In particular, we’ve been tracking how some of the software development practices (e.g., GitHub and Scrum) we’ve been implementing with students have fared in the remote working environment.\nI continue to be in awe of the resilience of Smithies (and their general fabulous-ness)!\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis year was full of ups and downs for me…and for many others it seems. In the fall (after pivoting my research questions due to the COVID shut down!) I successfully collected daily-diary data for a research project investigating household and childcare labor among cohabitating couples with at least one person working from home. It was exciting to start analyzing this data set with my students in my Spring 2021 research seminar. We have some interesting results that we’ll be writing up for publication together! In addition, this year I had a paper written with Sarah Bingham ’22 on Instagram use and self-objectification accepted for publication in Psychology of Popular Media and I submitted a paper written with Kat Kyuchukova ’19, Asha Hinson ’19, and Lanee Jung ’20 on objectification in interactions among women for publication.\nAfter a Spring 2020 sabbatical and a Fall 2020 course release, I had my first remote teaching experience teaching SDS 290 during J-term this year. Shout out to Julie Destine ’21 and Audrey Bertin ’21 — I simply could not have taught this crazy face-paced J-term course without your assistance and swift grading! And shout out to all of my J-term students for working so hard. It was a pleasure to have that experience with you! In the Spring I taught my Psychology of Women and Gender course and my Research Seminar. It was nice to find that I was still able to build relationships with my students, and to help them build community with each other, even in the remote environment. But I’m definitely ready to get back in the classroom!\nI read lots of classic books this year including Pride and Prejudice, the Harry Potter series, Dune, and the Golden Compass series. All for the very first time! I am currently reading the Lord or the Rings: Two Towers. I also read The Fate of Food and Braiding Sweetgrass which was amazing — thanks to Ester Zhao ’21 for the recommendation! There was also a lot of Nintendo playing and gardening in my life.\n\n\nWill Hopper\nThis fall, I’ll be returning to teach my greatest hits, SDS 201 (Statistical Methods for Undergraduates) and SDS 291 (Multiple Regression). I’m most excited to adapt some ideas and methods for creating a more interactive lecture experience, inspired by the experience of teaching online, to the physical classroom. Oddly enough, I’ve taught more semesters online than in-person, so in some ways returning to campus will be the strange adaptation, rather than the other way around! Regardless of locale, I’m sure I’ll continue to be impressed by the tenacity and commitment of the students in my classes.\nI continued to enjoy playing competitive Pokémon in the VGC format, and I even won my first prize money (well, $24, but still, it’s something!). I’m enjoying the current series 10 ruleset, and looking forward to the upcoming Diamond/Pearl remakes coming this fall. Pokémon is a game full of probabilities, so expect a few examples if you’re taking one of my classes!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello SDS world! It being my sabbatical year, I taught a single course in the fall: SDS 390 Ecological Forecasting. It was among the most rewarding teaching experiences of my career. Despite the remote circumstances, I felt like I had a chance to really bond with every student in the class. Not only did we apply data science tools and technology to answer ecological questions, but we also discussed larger topics like time-management, healthy work-life balance, and interpersonal skills in workplace settings.\nOn the research side of things, my work in forest ecology has been getting curiouser and curiouser. Here are three projects I’ve been involved in:\n\nStudying the growth phenology of trees i.e. how year-to-year changes in within-year climate variation is impacting the growth of trees. We found evidence that suggests even though growing seasons are getting longer (springs that start earlier and falls that end later), this is not translating to increased tree growth :(\nUsing Bayesian Hidden Markov Models to fuse disparate sources of tree data into a single model with the ultimate goal of forecasting the growth of trees.\nImplementing GitHub Actions continuous integration cyberinfrastructure to automate quality assurance and control of data on forest dynamics. The basic pipeline is: ecologists gather data in the field and then push the resulting spreadsheets to GitHub. This will then trigger data scripts that will automatically verify data quality and produce a dashboard of reports.\n\nOther than than during this year of COVID I’ve been playing a lot of tennis, fell into a Nintendo Switch Zelda Breath of the Wild wormhole for most of late December and January, and been doing a lot of soul-searching as a result of the anti-Asian hate crimes that occurred in Atlanta in March. Lastly, my beloved Montreal Canadiens made it to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since I was 12 years old. Despite an odds-defying run to the finals, they lost in 5 games to the repeat champion Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nWith both teaching and conferences all virtual, this year was like no other for sure! In the spring, I taught two different machine learning classes: Modeling for Machine Learning (SDS 293) and Computational Machine Learning (CSC 294). It was great to gather and work through the details of various Machine Learning concepts.\nSince last newsletter, I once again was a co-organizer for the Women In Music Information Retrieval Workshop and for the Machine Learning for Media Discovery Workshop. I had a lot of fun working with collaborators this year. Automatic Hierarchy Expansion for Improved Structure and Chord Evaluation with Brian McFee expands on our ISMIR 2019 paper. It was also fun to integrate my interests in MIR and pedagogy in Interactive Learning of Signal Processing Through Music: Making Fourier Analysis Concrete for Students with Meinard Mueller and Brian McFee. This summer, I’ve been privileged to work with five students through the SURF program, which is a great way to wrap up this year of virtual collaboration\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nAfter my first year virtual teaching, I’m so excited to finally be teaching in person and getting to participate in some Smithie traditions this Fall (I’ve been promised donuts). This Fall, I will be teaching my first dual prefixed course, SDS/GOV 338 Political Networks, and I look forward building more connections between GOV ad SDS.\nI used the pandemic as an excuse to explore every trail and state park I can with my dog, Gollum. Say hi if you see us walking around campus and I’m always looking for new trail recommendations! In the past year I have finished an upcoming book with Karen Mossberger and Caroline Tolbert on the importance of broadband for state and local economic and political development, and was honored to receive the best dissertation award from the State Politics and Policy Section of the American Political Science Association. I also have published papers in State Politics and Policy Quarterly, Politics Research Quarterly, and my first solo-authored publication in Social Science Quarterly.\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nI am so thrilled to be joining the faculty in SDS at Smith! Last month, I road-tripped across the country from Sacramento, CA where I was an Assistant Professor at UC Davis in a program called Science and Technology Studies (STS). STS is a social science discipline that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. Many of the courses that I will be teaching at Smith (such as Data Ethnography and Data and Social Justice) approach data science from this angle.\nAs if I wasn’t excited enough for my start day at Smith, that same day an article I’ve been working on for a year and half was published in the journal Big Data and Society. It describes how I’ve taught students to perform critical readings of datasets like the NYPD’s Stop, Question, and Frisk dataset and the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory. This year I also published in the Journal of Cultural Studies, co-published in the Science and Technology Studies journal, and collaborated with some amazing students and colleagues on the development of public interest databases and mapping tools. I can’t wait to bring Smith students on to some of these projects. I spent most evenings in 2021 cooking, working on mosaic projects, and attempting to match the energy of my spunky pup Maddie. Like me, she’s loving life here in Northampton!\n\n\nFatou Sanogo\nI am excited to be joining the SDS program as a lecturer for the year! I just finished my PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) this summer and I am looking forward to teaching intro stats and Modeling for Machine Learning at Smith.\nI have lived in Birmingham since I first came to the US back in 2013 and this will be a big move for me. I can’t wait to start this new adventure at Smith :) I am planning on a 3 days road trip from Birmingham to Northampton which should be fun!"

I am studying the sex-specific effects of the genetic architecture of various diseases. I’ve also worked on generating several graphics and figures for my lab’s publications.\nBrittany Bennett ’16: is on her second year of serving as the Data Director of the Sunrise Movement. She leverages analytics engineering to uncover insight for organizers working to pass a Green New Deal. You can follow her writing here\nStephanie Eckman ’94: Currently a Fellow at RTI International where I conduct research into data quality. I was elected a fellow of the ASA this year.\nShuli Hu ’18: I finished the Research Assistant Program at the International Monetary Fund and will be starting the MBA program at the University of Cambridge in a few months. I cannot ask for a more fulfilling and delightful post-undergrad experience. Besides, DC is a beautiful city for young adults. Working from home has made us even busier. After a hectic year, I am finally taking a break and spending more time with family and friends.\nJennifer Kirk ’08: I’m still happily working as a statistical reviewer at US FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. I work primarily on vaccines, and the past year or so has been quite interesting, if nothing else. I’m also a member of the steering committee for the ASA Biopharm Section 2021 Regulator-Industry Workshop.\nI’d like to put in an advertisement for the FDA’s summer fellowship program which is open to undergrads, grad students, and recent graduates in STEM fields (including non-citizens): https://orise.orau.gov/fda/.\nI think the FDA is also currently hiring for PhD statisticians positions (maybe also masters, depends on the group) for citizens and non-citizens, if any alums are searching for jobs. Job advertisements are usually posted to the ASA’s job listing–let me know if you need a link and I can get one from work.\nMaja Miloslavjevic ’14: I’m about to have my 5 year anniversary at Microsoft in a few months. I spent the first few years as a Program Manager but switched career tracks and am now a Data & Applied Scientist. It feels so good to be back to my DS roots!\nLizzy (Atkins) Offermann ’15: Back in December 2020, I started my current role as the Senior Business Analyst for the 1,500+ provider Clinically Integrated Network for LifeBridge Health, a $2.5 billion regional health care organization based in northwest Baltimore and the surrounding counties. I govern the data quality and data flow across multiple electronic medical record (EMR) systems among a range of commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare value-based care programs, contributing to a deep knowledge of data integration in and out of EMRs. I have enjoyed working on an executive-level, overseeing the data for a multi-hospital network and providing usable data visualizations to leadership. In the meantime, I have been finishing up my master’s degree in Clinical and Translational Research from George Washington University and will officially conclude by the end of next month! I am currently working on my master’s capstone project with Randy Frost, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and it has been truly fabulous to reconnect especially over an interesting study! In my free time (what is that again?), I have been busy enjoying life with my 3.5 year old twins and husband, continuing my role as the head of the Smith Alumnae Admissions for the tri-state area, appreciating my role on the Board of the Smith College Club of Baltimore, and have been progressing in my role as Treasurer on the Smith Class of 2015 Cabinet.\nSara Stoudt ’15: I spent the year teaching other Smithies! My favorite activity was making “data phys” to help visualizations come to life off our screens. Another highlight of the year was the release of Deb Nolan and my book, Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science. Check it out!. Now I’m off to my next adventure at Bucknell University where I’ll start as an Assistant Professor in the fall.\nKara Van Allen ’20: I moved to Somerville just over a year ago and started working as a Litigation Analyst for a market research firm in Waltham. While I have enjoyed it as my first job after Smith, I am ready for my next adventure, hopefully one with a stronger statistics focus. I would love any and all support or leads from my Smith network!"

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nIt was a busy year in terms of faculty hiring.\n\nDavid Rockoff will be a MassMutual Faculty Fellow for 2018-2019. David finished his Ph.D. in statistics at the University of Arizona in the spring and just arrived in Northampton. He will be teaching introductory statistics.\nJennifer Smetzer is our new lab instructor. Jenny received her Ph.D. in Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology in 2017 at UMass. She is jointly appointed in SDS and Psychology, and will be teaching the labs for SDS 220 and SDS 201.\nAlbert Y. Kim and Katherine Kinnaird, both of whom were hired last year, have arrived at Smith and are now full-time tenure-track faculty. Albert’s position is fully in SDS, while Katie’s position is joint with computer science.\nOur program, director Joe O’Rourke, became the interim Provost when Katherine Rowe left Smith to become the president of William and Mary. Katherine was a champion of SDS, a fact mentioned in many articles about her time at Smith. Peter de Villiers of Psychology will serve as SDS chair in 2018-2019.\nBen Capistrant – who taught in SDS this year – is staying at Smith after accepting a tenure-track position in the School for Social Work. Ben will continue to teach two courses in SDS for at least the next three years. We are really happy to keep him in the fold!\nWe were awarded a tenure-track, joint position with Government for next year. The hiring process is already underway. Please steer any qualified candidates our way!\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI’m looking forward to my first ever sabbatical in the fall of 2018. This year I taught the capstone course for the first time, brought 156 students through introduction to data science (SDS 192), and had two noteworthy papers accepted: “A Grammar for Reproducible and Painless Extract-Transform-Load Operations on Medium Data” is going to the Journal of Computational and Statistical Graphics, and “How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding randomness in North American sport” is going to the Annals of Applied Statistics.\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\nJordan Crouser has just completed his first year as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and is pleased to maintain a courtesy appointment in SDS. His debut thesis student Ji Young Yun ’18 successfully defended the first human-computer interaction thesis in the history of the department, entitled “DiagnosisChecker: an Interactive Interface for Mitigating Diagnostic Bias in Mental Health Care”. Thank you Prof. Randi Garcia for serving as the second reader for this project! This summer, he has 7 SURF students working in the Human Computation and Visualization Lab.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nIn my second year at Smith I developed a new 300-level research course, SDS/PSY 364 Research Seminar in Intergroup Relationships. In this course students learned about the psychology of dyadic and group relationships as well as how to statistically model dependency in data that violates the independence assumption. I also taught MTH/SDS 290, Research Design and Analysis, for this first time. Students in 290 conducted experiments in collaboration with the Smith Botanic Gardens with help from a curriculum enhancement grant. To top off a great year of teaching, at this year’s Rally Day, I proudly (and nervously) received the SGA’s junior faculty teaching award!\nThis year I published research articles in Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, And Practice, Sexual and Relationship Therapy: Special Issue on Shining Light into the Darkness: Bisexuality and Relationships, and in Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. I presented research at the National Council for Family Relations’ annual meeting and at UMass Amherst’s Social Psychology lunchtime brown bag.\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nI have been on sabbatical this year, and I devoted much of the fall to helping my husband clean out and fix up his farm in Connecticut. His family had lived on the farm since 1910. While cleaning out the house and barn, we discovered a lot of family history through old pictures and interesting objects. We sold the farm in January to a family with five girls who we hope will enjoy the place as much as we have.\nI intended my project for the spring to be revising the math stat course, and a great opportunity came along when three students who needed to take the course could not travel to Mount Holyoke to take it there. I volunteered to teach a seminar in math stat and through that teaching learned how I want to change the course for the next time I teach it.\nIn January, I was invited to become a “Distinguished Visiting Professor of Statistics” at Middlebury College for the 2018-19 academic year. I suspect I will be temporarily filling the place Albert Kim left when Smith hired him to start teaching with us next fall! I will teach two applied statistics courses and do statistical consulting while I am at Middlebury, and I will see all of you when I return in the fall of 2019. Please make sure to look for Albert and welcome him to Smith when you return in the fall.\n\n\nLu Lu\nI just finished my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Smith. I am glad to have the opportunity of teaching Multiple Regression in Spring. In the summer, I’m attending local talks and conferences related to data science in finance and preparing for a two-day course in this field for MassMutual. I’m also doing research on modeling equity data and quantitative trading strategies.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\nAfter three great years teaching at Smith, I’m moving to the University of St Thomas, in St Paul, MN. I’m joining the Department of Computer & Information Sciences, but I’ll still be teaching statistics, and helping them develop their data analytics program. I’m really going to miss all the Smithies and the fantastic SDS program. However, I grew up in Minnesota and am excited to be back closer to my family and friends. My new email address is amelia.mcnamara@stthomas.edu Please stay in touch!\n\n\nMiles Ott\nIt was an eventful first year: I got to teach Intro Probability and Statistics both semesters, took part in my first five college datafest, and am all set up with a whopping 12 potted plants in my office. This summer I am looking forward to working with two SURF students to analyze a social network data set to better understand how one’s position in a social network is related to certain demographic characteristics and health behaviors. I will be presenting on some new research extending Generalized Estimating Equations to the network context at JSM in Vancouver, I hope to see many other Smithies there. I also will be speaking at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) at Brown University in August at a workshop on “Building Community in the Foundations of Data Science”, which sounds like my kind of fun! In the fall I am looking forward to to teaching a class on statistical analysis of social networks and welcoming Bert Kim, Jenny Smetzer, and Katie Kinnaird to SDS!"

Students complete courses in five focus areas, allowing a customized educational experience that addresses the unique professional development needs of each student.\nThe application deadline for the spring is October 31. https://gradschool.umd.edu/behavioralsocial-sciences/mpds\nElizabeth Offermann (Atkins) ’15: I have continued my work in the Department of Neuropsychology at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and am loving it! Right now I am working on a project looking at early iron deficiency and the relationship to attention issues later in childhood. We have folks coming in for blood draws, MRIs, and neuropsychological testing of attention. We are about to analyze some preliminary data, which I am pumped to get started! We have our eye on a few conferences coming up to submit our results. I am also working on a cancer survivorship study looking at the transition back to school and where support lacks especially when it comes to neuropsychological evaluation of being ready to go back to school after cancer treatment. I am also working on a study exploring a phenomenon called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo and trying to figure out how exactly these kiddos are slower and in what capacity. Exciting news from my department - we were just in the New York Times! My department chair, Dr. Mark Mahone, was interviewed for NBC nightly news about a study I have worked on evaluating the brains of preschoolers with ADHD and how they are different from those without ADHD and from their younger selves. The article is called “Scans Show Differences in Brains of Preschoolers With ADHD.”\nIn other news, my husband and I welcomed our identical twin boys, Owen (6lbs 14oz) and Timothy (7lbs 2oz), in January! They are bundles of fun cooing and giggling like wild. It has been such a joyful six months so far! Here are some pictures with Owen on the left:\nSara Stoudt ’15: I finished year three of the PhD (ah!) and am making progress on a project on species distribution and abundance modeling and a book on Prof. Deb Nolan and my experience teaching a writing class for statisticians. For the summer I’m interning at the Farmers Business Network (a startup that crowdsources farmer data to help them making planting, buying, and selling decisions), my first taste of industry!\nLiz Stuart ’97: I guess if you’re looking for things you can say that I had a blast coming back to give the The Dorothy Wrinch Lecture in Biomathematics at the Women in Mathematics in New England Conference in September 2017, and that I especially appreciated the efforts to find childcare for my 6 year old so I could attend and present!\nMaria Terres ’09: I’m currently a Senior Quantitative Researcher at The Climate Corporation, and this summer I’m mentoring my first intern! Last October I presented my work in precision agriculture at the Women in Statistics and Data Science conference in La Jolla, CA - it was great to see a lot of other Smithies there! This summer I’ll be at JSM presenting some of my postdoc work in Bayesian spectral modeling for spatial processes. I’m also Treasurer for the ENVR section, so I encourage you all to attend our mixer! On a more personal note, my daughter Ottavia was born in January. Those of you attending JSM may get a chance to meet her.\nIf there are any other Bay Area Smithies out there, please feel free to get in touch; a couple of us have been meeting for brunch from time to time, and it would be fun to have a bigger group!\nJingyang (Judy) Zhang ’14: Happy Summer! I have been admitted by the Northwestern phd program in Statistics and will be attending this fall."

    "text": "It has been an incredibly big year for our fledgling program in Statistical & Data Sciences! Our program can now claim to have Smith’s newest major. In keeping with Smith’s tradition for blazing trails, we are the first women’s college—and only the second liberal arts college—in the country to have a major that includes “data science” in its title. The major in SDS consists of 10 courses, including depth in both statistics and computer science, an integrating course in data science, a course that emphasizes communication, and an application domain of expertise. We have developed a number of new courses to support this curriculum. We hope to be able to continue to add new faculty members to the program to staff these expanded offerings. The immediate success of our recent alumnae (more on that later) has played no small role in building the momentum our program is seeing on campus!\nSome more updates:\n\nFive new courses were developed and taught in 2015-16.\n\nSDS 235: Visual Analytics (Fall 2015)\nSDS 390: Advanced Topics in SDS (Fall 2015)\nSDS 136: Communicating with Data (Spring 2016)\nSDS 192: Intro to Data Science (Spring 2016)\nSDS 293: Machine Learning (Spring 2016)\n\nYiwen Zhu ’16 completed a self-designed major in “Statistical & Data Sciences” before the official major was approved, so she is our first unofficial graduate. Yiwen also majored in PSY and will attend an M.A. program in biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health.\nIn 2015, MassMutual Financial Group awarded Smith College an $800,000 grant for the Women in Data Science Program. Funds were used to hire two visiting assistant professors to deepen the curriculum in data science. The visiting professors include:\n\nR. Jordan Crouser ’08, Visiting Assistant Professor, MassMutual Faculty Fellow\nJordan’s research program investigates the complementary nature of human and machine computation as used in visual analytics and other human-machine collaborative systems. Jordan earned his M.S. in educational technology and Ph.D. in computer science from the VALT: Visual Analytics Laboratory at Tufts University in 2013, and is a 2008 graduate of Smith College.\nAmelia McNamara, Visiting Assistant Professor, MassMutual Faculty Fellow\nAmelia has a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.A. from Macalester College, with double majors in English and mathematics. Amelia’s research is multidisciplinary, including components of statistics education, statistical computing, data visualization, and spatial statistics.\n\nSmith was awarded a three-year $287,426 grant from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL), their STEM higher education reform center dedicated to “Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM” (TIDES). Smith is using this funding to concentrate on the retention of underrepresented students in computer science, including designing and implementing SDS 192 as a “first contact programming”” course.\nSince the inauguration of the program, six Smith alums have been hired by MassMutual Financial Group as Data Analytics Consultants. All of them are participating in the exclusive Data Science Development Program. This is an intense, three-year program that combines academic coursework with the practical experience of working on data science projects for MassMutual. The Smith Data Analytics Consultants include:\n\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick ’14: B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics.\n\nDana Udwin ’14: B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in East Asian Languages & Literature.\n\nGalen Long ’15: B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Logic.\nEmma Beauchamp ’16: B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Applied Statistics.\nMartha Miller (AC) ’16: B.A. in Psychology with a minor in Applied Statistics.\nJordan Menter ’16: B.A. in Mathematics\n\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick ’14 and Dana Udwin ’14 presented their work done at MassMutual Data Labs in Amherst on “Data Visualization with D3.” Nearly 50 students, faculty, and local data professionals were in attendance at this event.\nAmanda Cox, a graphics editor at the New York Times, gave a talk on “Data Visualization at the New York Times” on December 4, 2015, to nearly 200 people.\nYiwen Zhu ’16 and Emma Beauchamp ’16 shared Smith’s Five College Statistics Prize for outstanding independent research, thesis, or capstone course project in statistics. Yiwen (a psychology-statistics double major) and Emma (a sociology major and applied statistics minor) both completed outstanding senior theses in their respective fields. Yiwen studied client emotional response during psychotherapy sessions, while Emma studied the role of stigma in sexual health behavior in adolescent girls. Both applied a wide range of statistical techniques and demonstrated exceptional statistical maturity in their work.\nPlease follow us on Twitter @SmithCollegeSDS or visit our website for more information on the program!

    "text": "It has been an incredibly big year for our fledgling program in Statistical & Data Sciences! Our program can now claim to have Smith’s newest major. In keeping with Smith’s tradition for blazing trails, we are the first women’s college—and only the second liberal arts college—in the country to have a major that includes “data science” in its title. The major in SDS consists of 10 courses, including depth in both statistics and computer science, an integrating course in data science, a course that emphasizes communication, and an application domain of expertise. We have developed a number of new courses to support this curriculum. We hope to be able to continue to add new faculty members to the program to staff these expanded offerings. The immediate success of our recent alumnae (more on that later) has played no small role in building the momentum our program is seeing on campus!\nSome more updates:\n\nFive new courses were developed and taught in 2015-16.\n\nSDS 235: Visual Analytics (Fall 2015)\nSDS 390: Advanced Topics in SDS (Fall 2015)\nSDS 136: Communicating with Data (Spring 2016)\nSDS 192: Intro to Data Science (Spring 2016)\nSDS 293: Machine Learning (Spring 2016)\n\nYiwen Zhu ’16 completed a self-designed major in “Statistical & Data Sciences” before the official major was approved, so she is our first unofficial graduate. Yiwen also majored in PSY and will attend an M.A. program in biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health.\nIn 2015, MassMutual Financial Group awarded Smith College an $800,000 grant for the Women in Data Science Program. Funds were used to hire two visiting assistant professors to deepen the curriculum in data science. The visiting professors include:\n\nR. Jordan Crouser ’08, Visiting Assistant Professor, MassMutual Faculty Fellow\nJordan’s research program investigates the complementary nature of human and machine computation as used in visual analytics and other human-machine collaborative systems. Jordan earned his M.S. in educational technology and Ph.D. in computer science from the VALT: Visual Analytics Laboratory at Tufts University in 2013, and is a 2008 graduate of Smith College.\nAmelia McNamara, Visiting Assistant Professor, MassMutual Faculty Fellow\nAmelia has a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.A. from Macalester College, with double majors in English and mathematics. Amelia’s research is multidisciplinary, including components of statistics education, statistical computing, data visualization, and spatial statistics.\n\nSmith was awarded a three-year $287,426 grant from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL), their STEM higher education reform center dedicated to “Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM” (TIDES). Smith is using this funding to concentrate on the retention of underrepresented students in computer science, including designing and implementing SDS 192 as a “first contact programming”” course.\nSince the inauguration of the program, six Smith alums have been hired by MassMutual Financial Group as Data Analytics Consultants. All of them are participating in the exclusive Data Science Development Program. This is an intense, three-year program that combines academic coursework with the practical experience of working on data science projects for MassMutual. The Smith Data Analytics Consultants include:\n\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick ’14: B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics.\n\nDana Udwin ’14: B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in East Asian Languages & Literature.\n\nGalen Long ’15: B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Logic.\nEmma Beauchamp ’16: B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Applied Statistics.\nMartha Miller (AC) ’16: B.A. in Psychology with a minor in Applied Statistics.\nJordan Menter ’16: B.A. in Mathematics\n\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick ’14 and Dana Udwin ’14 presented their work done at MassMutual Data Labs in Amherst on “Data Visualization with D3.” Nearly 50 students, faculty, and local data professionals were in attendance at this event.\nAmanda Cox, a graphics editor at the New York Times, gave a talk on “Data Visualization at the New York Times” on December 4, 2015, to nearly 200 people.\nYiwen Zhu ’16 and Emma Beauchamp ’16 shared Smith’s Five College Statistics Prize for outstanding independent research, thesis, or capstone course project in statistics. Yiwen (a psychology-statistics double major) and Emma (a sociology major and applied statistics minor) both completed outstanding senior theses in their respective fields. Yiwen studied client emotional response during psychotherapy sessions, while Emma studied the role of stigma in sexual health behavior in adolescent girls. Both applied a wide range of statistical techniques and demonstrated exceptional statistical maturity in their work.\nPlease follow us on Twitter @SmithCollegeSDS or visit our website for more information on the program! There is also a Facebook group. Please help us reach out to other alumnae by having them contact me!"

    "text": "Faculty Updates\n\nWe hired Randi L. Garcia as a tenure-track faculty member. Randi’s position will be split jointly with Psychology. Randi earned her B.A. in psychology and women’s studies from the University of California, Los Angeles and her Ph.D in social psychology from the University of Connecticut. She also completed an M.S. in statistics at UConn. After graduate school she held a postdoctoral research associate position at Princeton University. Randi’s current research in small group processes continues to explore how demographic differences and individuals’ identification with their social groups influence psychological group formation. The focus of this work is on finding the contexts that make demographic differences more salient and more potent predictors of a person’s feelings towards the group in addition to exploring the effects of group composition and identification on the behaviors within these groups.\nSmith is conducting a search for a tenure-track faculty position in SDS for the fall 2017. This will bring the program’s permanent staffing level to 3.0 FTE (new person, Baumer, and 50% of Garcia and Halvorsen) in addition to the two MassMutual Faculty Fellows (Crouser and McNamara).\nR. Jordan Crouser ’08 has received two grants from the U.S. Department of Defense totaling more than $100,000. These research projects include:\n\n“Theoretical Models of Human-Machine Interaction in Streaming Analysis Contexts.”\n“A Survey of Visual Analytics Tools for Effective Decision-Making.”\n\nBen Baumer shared the Contemporary Baseball Analysis Award for his article “OpenWAR: An Open Source System for Evaluating Overall Player Performance in Major League Baseball,” which appeared in the June 2015 edition of the Journal of Quantitative Analysis.\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI’m continuing to build my “three-legged stool” consisting of sports analytics, statistics and data science education, and network science. This past year I wrote a widely-read article for ESPN.com about the state of analytics in baseball, had a paper on our data science course published in The American Statistician, and completed a paper on graph labelling with the help of Yijin Wei ’16 that will be published in Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory. Right now I’m trying to finish a textbook on data science using R. After serving as Director of SDS for two years and I am happy to hand over that responsibility to Joe O’Rourke of the computer science department. SDS is the fastest-growing department at Smith and there is still much work to be done as we launch our official major! Here is a recent picture of my daughter eating a cheese wheel (couldn’t resist):\n\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\nis beginning his second year as a Visiting Assistant Professor and MassMutual Faculty Fellow in the Statistical and Data Sciences Program. His research interests are Human-Computer Interaction and Visual Analytics, with a focus on human computation and human-computer teams. With the support of an incredible team of SEVEN undergraduate research assistants, work in the Human Computation and Visualization Laboratory is rapidly gaining speed. New this summer: Jordan and his team have begun a collaboration with practitioners in Community-Based Mental Health! In this project, we explore how computational tools might help provide more equitable access to services, as well as how insights from the field might help computer scientists better understand how humans think.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nis a new faculty member joining SDS and Psychology this Fall. She is interested in the analysis of nested data from pairs and groups of people including when those measurements are taken overtime. Her research in psychology investigates the effects of race and gender in interpersonal encounters. Specifically, she is interested in the effects of sexual objectification and how are attitudes about race affect interracial friendships. Randi is looking forward to teaching statistics in the SDS department next spring!\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nWe expanded our statistics and data science electives through the new program in Statistics and Data Sciences this year, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to teach a new course in the fall term, “Categorical Data Analysis,” a 300-level elective for our advanced statistics students. Ten students from Smith, UMass, and Mount Holyoke enrolled in the course. I also taught Research Design in the fall and one section of Introduction to Probability and Statistics (MTH/SDS 220) and its two lab sections in the spring. This summer I am working with a research assistant on a project looking at financial investment strategies from a statistical perspective. Our hope for this project is to develop some new options for student projects in MTH/SDS 220.\nI also serve on the Mathematics Academic Advisory Committee of the College Board and continue to direct the MWM Program for the American Statistical Association (ASA). MWM provides a workshop for high school and middle school teachers to learn to teach the statistics in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, and the ASA sponsors MWM each year at the Joint Statistics Meetings in August.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\njust completed her first year as a visiting assistant professor in the Statistical and Data Sciences program. She was happy to return to a liberal arts setting (her BA is from Macalester College, where she double-majored in English and math) and loved all the bright, curious students. In April, she gave a talk called “Do you know Nothing when you see it?” at Bocoup’s OpenVisConf. This summer, she is balancing research with travel to a number of conferences and workshops.\nAs an incoming TIER fellow, she will be attending a workshop on reproducible research at Haverford College, followed by a workshop on teaching R at Pomona College, and the R user’s conference, useR!, at Stanford University. Later in the summer she will attend the SIAM annual meeting in Boston, Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago and the Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit at UC Berkeley."

This fall, she’ll be pursuing an MS in CS at Tufts University and is very excited to continue her education in data science.\nDeirdre Fitzpatrick ’14: I am working at MassMutual in the Data Science Development Program out of Amherst, MA. At the same time, I am working on getting my MS in statistics at UMass Amherst, and should be finishing that up next spring.\nJingyang (Judy) Zhang ’14: I am still at Smith working for ITS as Application Systems Analyst. I have been working on projects related to pulling data from and writing data to the DB. I am currently working on Smith new website’s directory, writing web services that pull directory data into the website and display it nicely.\nLizzy Atkins ’15: I am working with Dr. Anne Comi at the Kennedy Krieger Institute / Johns Hopkins in Maryland in the neurology department. I am doing research on a rare genetic disease, Sturge-Weber syndrome. I work on data analysis every day, manuscript preparation, submissions to conferences, and clinical recruitment tasks with our patients. We are about to get stared with an FDA-approved, NIH-funded clinical drug trial that I will spearhead gulp. I very much enjoy what I am doing though I am looking forward to the next step - graduate school!\nIn my spare time, I am studying for the GRE and working as a Smith alumnae admissions coordinator for the Smith College Club of Baltimore. I get to talk about all things Smith to interested applicants - the BEST role for me!\nYadira Flores ’15: Currently, I am an application developer for Wharton Research Data Services on their data team. My work implements many of the skills I learned in classes like Data Science. My work involves coding in Python and SAS – a statistical language I was able to pick up quickly because of my experience with R and SQL – to bring on new financial data and update existing data. At the present time, our team is also working on creating visualizations for the most popular financial databases so I applying my visualizations knowledge that I learned in my Statistics classes.\nI’m learning many new technical skills such as learning about Linux, database storage, and general coding skills. I’m really enjoying my job and I know this will be a good stepping stone to my career.\nYungjen Kung ’15: I’m glad that Smith is offering more data science courses and wish I had the chance to take them! I’m still at Northwestern, working on an MS in analytics. I will be graduating December 2016 and will be interning at Nielsen this summer.\nGalen Long ’15: Galen’s currently in the MassMutual Data Science Development Program, a three-year program that combines graduate coursework with hands-on company projects. They spend their days running Python scripts with Apache Spark, learning more about statistics, and cursing at their computer.\nErika Miguel ’15: My first year out of college has been an exciting roller coaster. I started as a software developer at Goldman Sachs in July, building APIs and Java/AngularJS webapps. I put in my two weeks notice two weeks ago and on Monday will be joining a startup in Soho, where I’ll be a DevOps engineer.\nSara Stoudt ’15: I am finishing up my first year in the Statistics PhD program at UC Berkeley. Some highlights (besides surviving :D) were helping to organize Berkeley’s first DataFest and working on an interdisciplinary project as part of the Data Sciences for the 21st Century: Environment and Society program. I will be splitting my time this summer between NIST, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the San Francisco Estuary Institute."
