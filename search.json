Like everyone else, we are struggling through the global COVID-19 pandemic (still). We are fighting for racial justice, asking ourselves tough questions about privilege, racism, and white supremacy, and making moves towards a more just future (still). Among the year‚Äôs many highlights, perhaps the most enduring will be the successful effort by Miles Ott ‚Äô01 to petition the ASA to rename the Fisher Award (one of the most prestigious in all of statistics). R.A. Fisher was a virulent eugenicist, but thanks in part to Miles‚Äôs leadership, his award has been officially retired.\nThis newsletter is mostly a distillation of our Twitter @SmithCollegeSDS feed.

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nSome big changes occurred on the faculty side:\n\nAfter 31 years of teaching statistics at Smith, Katherine Halvorsen retired. Unfortunately, Katherine‚Äôs much-deserved retirement party was postponed due to the pandemic, but we‚Äôll celebrate her once gatherings of more than 30 people are allowed on campus. As you might have expected given Katherine‚Äôs work ethic, she is still planning to teach two classes this academic year.\nJenny Smetzer, Dhanamalee Bandara, and David Rockoff have left the College.\nBen Baumer received tenure and promotion to associate professor, and has taken over as SDS chair. Ben is the first faculty member to receive tenure as a member of SDS.\nWe hired Scott LaCombe to a tenure-track position that is joint with the Government department (see below). Wish Scott well, he now has to deal with two different Baumers for department chairs! r emoji::emoji(\"laughing\")\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15 finished her PhD at UC-Berkeley and was hired as a Lecturer. Even though Sara technically predates the SDS program, like many of you she is living proof that we are doing something right over here.\n\n\n\nSome news üóûÔ∏è: today is my first day as part of the @SmithCollegeSDS team. What a dream!\n\n‚Äî Sara Stoudt, PhD (@sastoudt) July 1, 2020\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI‚Äôm trying to enjoy all the time at home with my wife and two children. r emoji::emoji(\"zany face\") Alice is 6, and she can now read, swim, ride a bike, and log in to a Linux terminal. Arlo is 3 and she is an adorable terror. Today I woke up when she jumped on my head (true story).\nLast fall, I taught a new course on advanced programming with R, that was very rewarding for both the students and me. They wrote 11 R packages in three weeks, some of which have already built up a user base and may make it onto CRAN!\nI‚Äôm now a tenured associate professor, which is strange and wonderful. I‚Äôm working on finishing a 2nd edition of our data science textbook, Modern Data Science with R. This one will have a free online version! This is been a very trying year, but I‚Äôm so encouraged by all the incredible work our alums are doing and all the fabulous colleagues I get to work with!\nIt still doesn‚Äôt feel real that Sara Stoudt ‚Äô15 has finished her PhD and will be working with us (especially since no one meets in person anymore!). Things have truly come full circle for me and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis crazy year is divided in half by COVID-19! One highlight for me from the before times is that I took five Smith students to the Women in Statistics and Data Science‚Äôs annual conference held this year in Bellevue Washington. Our flight out of Bradley was cancelled due to a plane crash, so we changed our flights to Logan. We then left a wallet in the Valley Transporter van upon arrival at Logan (but got it back!) and then we left a laptop at TSA in route to our gate (but got it back later!). In the end we MADE it! It was a joy to speak on the plenary panel, ‚ÄúCreating and Sustaining Respectful and Inclusive Community‚Äù and to attend my first WSDS! In the Fall semester I also taught my research seminar PSY 364: Research seminar in Intergroup Relationships for the second time, and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. It was lovely! During COVID times I‚Äôve picked up several hobbies including gardening, cooking, meditation, reading for pleasure and personal growth, and beginner guitar. This year I‚Äôve published papers in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology and Frontiers in Psychology‚Äôs section on Gender, Sex and Sexualities. I‚Äôve also recently submitted a paper investigating daily instagram use and women‚Äôs self-objectification for publication in a psychology journal.\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nLast fall I returned from teaching at Middlebury College in 2018‚Äì19 to teach at Smith again. September was a challenging month. I plunged back into Smith advising, committee work, and teaching Probability and Categorical Data Analysis. I became the Honors Chair for Math and Stat. I served as honors advisor to Crystal Zang ‚Äô20 in SDS and as a reader for Aoi Ogawa ‚Äô20‚Äôs thesis in SDS. I visited Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, as a member of their visiting committee for the Math and Stat Department, and I continue to serve on the Board of Directors for the American Statistical Association and on the ASA‚Äôs Council of Sections Governing Board. In the beginning of the spring term my husband and I enjoyed several Smith basketball home games. After spring break and during the move to online teaching we have turned to jigsaw puzzles for amusement and long walks. My big news is that I have retired after 31 years teaching at Smith. I knew I would miss you all and thus I‚Äôve signed up to teach part-time next year: Probability in the fall and Math Stat in the spring.\n\n\nWill Hopper\nI‚Äôm excited to start my first full year at Smith, and keep doing what I do best: introducing students to their new favorite subject, statistics! I‚Äôll be teaching SDS 201, which introduces people to the wonderful world of statistical modeling, as well as SDS 291, which goes more into depth with Multiple Regression, and introduces people to an even wider family of statistical models. Thanks to teaching remotely, I‚Äôve revived my video production and editing skills that have lied dormant since undergraduate film classes. Despite the circumstances, I‚Äôve had a lot of fun making silly thumbnails and pretending I‚Äôm a YouTuber.\nWhen I‚Äôm not thinking about how to explain the nuances of a two-tailed hypothesis test, I love playing competetive Pok√©mon, specifically the VGC format. I‚Äôve been playing with Ashton Cox‚Äôs Pincurchin/Raichu Team recently, which has absolutely tanked my ranking, but it‚Äôs all in good fun. Come to office hours if you want to team-build with me!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nWhat a bonkers 2019-2020 it has been! We‚Äôll be telling our grandchildren‚Äôs generation about it for sure! This past year I taught, both in-person and remotely, SDS 220 Intro Stats twice, SDS 192 Intro to Data Science, as well as SDS‚Äôs revamped SDS 293 Modeling for Machine Learning. Some highlights of this past year:\n\nI was honoured with the 2020 Faculty Teaching Award from the Smith College Student Government Association for outstanding dedication to teaching! Thanks Smithies!\nIn September, I accompanied four Smithies to StatFest 2019 at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston TX. StatFest is a one-day ASA conference aimed at encouraging undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups to consider careers and graduate studies in the statistical sciences.\nThe print edition of my Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse textbook was published by CRC Press.\nMy first foray into forest ecology research was published by the Public Library of Science journal PLOS One: A permutation test and spatial cross-validation approach to assess models of interspecific competition between trees. Try saying that title three times fast!\n\nLastly, my normal self-care routines took a big hit from the shoulder surgery I had in December as well as the pandemic. Some new outlets for well-being I‚Äôve discovered as a result include: sensory deprivation epsom salt-water floats, TRX suspension training, spinning, going on long walks, and gardening. Although a family of deer are constantly eating all my crops r emoji::emoji(\"deer\")``r emoji::emoji(\"deer\")``r emoji::emoji(\"deer\")``r emoji::emoji(\"herb\")!\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nIt‚Äôs almost strange to think that our last newsletter was just a year ago! My second year at Smith included teaching new courses, attending conferences, submitting research papers for review, bringing collaborators to Smith, and knitting (both Rmd files and actual yarn). A few highlights from this year, include:\n\nJourneying to International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference in the Netherlands with seven Smithies in November. They opened the main conference presenting their peer-reviewed paper and then spent the rest of the week discussing music, computer science, and video games with leading experts in the field. They were constantly mistaken for graduate students, which was really cool.\nCo-Organizing the Women in MIR workshop (that four Smithies attended!) and attending the Women in Machine Learning workshop in 2019\nBeing part of the Kahn Project TranslationS and worked on my book proposal with my collaborator Prof.¬†John Laudun. Prof.¬†Laudun was also able to visit Smith, where we shared our work at the Liberal Arts Lunch.\nSupervising Jessica Keast ‚Äô20‚Äôs SDS thesis. It was a great project, and it was an absolute highlight of my year to see her present her work (over Zoom) to an audience that included SDS majors, MIR experts, and faculty as well as her friends and family. Jessica also won the annual SDS Research Prize for her collection of research conducted at Smith, including her thesis and work on the ISMIR paper.\n\nThere‚Äôs lots to be excited about for next year, including our amazing new SDS colleagues Will Hopper, Scott LaCombe, and Sara Stoudt ‚Äô15! Looking forward to working with all of them!\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nScott LaCombe is joining Smith College this Fall with a joint appointment in Statistical and Data Sciences and Government. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa and will be living in New England for the first time. Scott‚Äôs focus is leveraging data to better understand how public opinion is translated into state policies, and what networks states have formed when developing policy solutions. He is very excited to be teaching in the Fall and exploring the Pioneer Valley.\n\n\nMiles Ott\nWhat a year! Before everything got locked down I traveled to Santiago, Chile to work with my collaborator Isabelle Beaudry, to Irvine to work with Alicia Johnson and Smith Alum Mine Dogucu ‚Äô09 on our forthcoming textbook Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R, and to Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine to talk about my research in respondent driven sampling. This year I taught Intro Stats in the fall, and for the first time I taught the SDS Capstone course in the spring. My first SDS major advisees graduated, and I am so proud of all of them! I joined the development committee of the American Statistical Association, and am excited to learn more about the ASA as an organization. I am delighted to be working with new SDS colleagues Will Hopper, Scott LaCombe, and Sara Stoudt ‚Äô15! Special message to alums: I love hearing/reading your updates!\n\n\nSara Stoudt\nI‚Äôm excited to jump up to this part of the newsletter this year. :) I finished my PhD in statistics at UC Berkeley this summer and am joining the SDS program as a lecturer for the year. I‚Äôm looking forward to teaching Communicating with Data and intro stats (and being back in Herrell‚Äôs territory).\nSince the last newsletter I had an amazing summer at the LA Times, I wrote my dissertation (‚ÄúA Statistical Investigation of Species Distribution Models and Communication of Statistics Across Disciplines‚Äù), Deb Nolan and I submitted our ‚ÄúCommunicating with Data‚Äù book, and I picked up some other fun projects along the way."

Ben Baumer was also promoted to full Professor.\nAlbert Kim is the 2023 winner of the Waller Education Award, given annually by the ASA Section on Statistics and Data Science Education! Previous winners from Smith include Ben Baumer (2019) and Nick Horton (2009).\nWe hired Casey Berger to a joint tenure-track position with the Physics department. Casey has been teaching at Smith already and her research is in applying high performance computing and machine learning methods to many-body quantum systems. She has already designed a new course, SDS 271, which she will offer in the fall as a Python-based alternative to SDS 270. Casey was just recently elected as a Member-At-Large for the Topical Group in Data Science within the American Physics Society. We‚Äôre super-excited to keep her at Smith!\nWe also hired Rebecca Kurtz-Garcia into a joint tenure-track position with the Mathematical Sciences department. Rebecca comes to us from the University of California, Riverside, where she recently completed her Ph.D.¬†in statistics. Rebecca works in the intersection of time series analysis, econometrics, spectral analysis, and steady state simulation. She is starting as a Project NExT fellow this summer, and will be teaching introductory statistics and mathematical statistics in her first year. Yay!\nAfter completing his first year, Jared Joseph is moving on to pursue a permanent job in the criminal investigations unit of the Internal Revenue Service. We‚Äôre sad to see Jared go, but excited to see what he does next!\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI am about to embark on what I can only hope will be a fantastic adventure during the full-year sabbatical I‚Äôm now starting: my family and I will spend the year in Medell√≠n, Colombia! I will have an appointment as a Visiting Faculty member at the Universidad EAFIT, and I am also anticipating extending my current role as interim Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports for a three-year term. Learning a new language in your forties hasn‚Äôt been easy, but I took SPN 200 at Smith this spring with Prof.¬†Adri√°n Gras-Velazquez and learned a lot while making some new friends.\nCuando vuelvo hablaremos espa√±ol juntos!\n\n\nCasey Berger\nI‚Äôm so excited to be joining SDS here at Smith. I‚Äôve loved my last two years as a visitor in the physics department, but my work has always been interdisciplinary, so it feels fitting that I start my tenure-track role jointly appointed in PHY and SDS. I look forward to getting to know a whole new set of majors and embrace the challenges and joys of teaching and doing research across fields. My summer has already been packed with a return to conference travel ‚Äì my first in-person conferences and workshops since the pandemic started. It‚Äôs a nice blend of teaching, service, and research, starting with the American Physical Society‚Äôs Data Science Education Community of Practice (APS DSECOP) workshop on data science in the physics classroom, then helping coordinate events as an alum at the Annual Program Review for the DOE‚Äôs Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF), and finishing off the summer presenting at the International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory at FermiLab. As if that weren‚Äôt enough on my summer schedule, my spouse and I bought a house in the area and are moving in next month. It will be nice when the dust settles ‚Äì just in time for the fall semester!\n\n\nShiya Cao\nYear one at Smith was good, and I enjoyed research, teaching, and importantly, a supportive environment in SDS and Smith. In Fall 2022, I created the Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL) to advance my research in disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics. I had the pleasure to work with six Smithies Linh Pham ‚Äô25, Zhirou Liu ‚Äô25, Christy Yang ‚Äô25, Vicky Xu ‚Äô26, Nikki Lin ‚Äô25, and Amber Liu ‚Äô24 in my lab this year. A paper on Examining Environmental Barriers for Disabled Employees in Different Industries and Work Spaces I wrote with Christy Yang ‚Äô25 and Vicky Xu ‚Äô26 was accepted by WSDS 2023. This summer four SURF students (Christy Yang ‚Äô25, Vicky Xu ‚Äô26, Nikki Lin ‚Äô25, and Amber Liu ‚Äô24) joined my lab and worked on two research projects: (1) Integrating Disability Inclusion Components into Introductory Data Science Pedagogy and (2) Examining the Intersection of Disability, Race, and Gender in Shaping the Employment Outcomes of Higher Educated Individuals. I also advised Vicky Xu ‚Äô26 on a poster presentation she gave at the 2022 NextGen Data Science Day Conference. In addition, my coauthored book chapter titled ‚ÄúThe Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations‚Äù was published. I also gave a research talk at the UMASS Amherst Statistics and Data Science Seminar Series in Spring 2023. Moreover, I went to my first SDSS, attended some interesting talks, and met people who share similar research interests. This upcoming year I will continue working on publishing my dissertation papers, writing up papers from the lab projects, and explore some new research streams related to disability inclusion, statistics, and accessibility.\nThis fall, I will continue to teach SDS 192 Introduction to Data Science (taught two semesters this past year. Love it!) and develop and teach a research seminar course: SDS 300 Disability Inclusion and Data Analytics (so excited!). In the spring, I will also teach SDS 410 Capstone (looking forward!).\nI am also very proud of our book club this year! We read six books: Stoner, The Memory Police, Seven Empty Houses, The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, Lessons in Chemistry. We are currently reading The Personal Librarian. Looking forward to reading more books with my peers!\n\n\nKaitlyn Cook\nYear one is officially in the books! I had a wonderful time getting to know and work alongside the students, staff, and faculty in the SDS program‚Äîthank you for such a warm welcome to Northampton and to Smith.\nSome personal highlights from this past year include:\n\nTeaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220), Probability (MTH 246) and Mathematical Statistics (MTH/SDS 320), all for the first time, and adapting the latter two courses to include a strong focus on simulation in R.\nTemporarily buying Amazon out of loaded die. (It was for a good statistical cause!)\nPublishing an article on marginal proportional hazards models for clustered interval-censored data in Biometrics, continuing existing collaborations with sleep medicine and COVID-19 researchers in Boston, and building new connections and collaborations with the Five College statistics community and other researchers here at Smith.\n\nFinally, I would also be remiss to not mention the excellent progress I made on my reality TV show ‚Äúresearch‚Äù agenda, having managed to watch all 14 seasons of Ink Master and 31 seasons (and counting) of the Amazing Race within the last year.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nOn September 21, 2022 my daughter Devyn Sequoia Durbin was born! She is amazing and kept me very busy this year. I was lucky to have enjoyed parental leave in the fall and then a sabbatical in the spring. I took minimal time for research this year, but I did continue my collaborations with Nicole Campione-Barr at the University of Missouri on adolescent disclosure and family systems and with Sarah Witkowski in the Exercise and Sport Studies department here at Smith on perimenopause symptoms, activity, and cardiovascular health. I also took on a Associate Editor role at the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\nAs much as I enjoyed my time with family, I am excited to get back to teaching and research in the fall!! I also look forward to taking over as Chair of SDS next year so Ben can take a much needed break. Thank you for your service Ben!\n\n\nWill Hopper\n\n\nJared Joseph\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\n2022-2023 was a big academic year for me, both on personal and professional fronts. First, my spouse and I survived our first year of raising our beautiful daughter Gigi. Nothing describes the experience better that the old adage about parenting: ‚ÄúThe days are long, but the years are short.‚Äù Second, I got tenure and hence promoted to Associate Professor. It‚Äôs been a long time since I first started teaching at Reed College in 2013, but the journey has been a rewarding one. In particular, I got two papers published that I‚Äôm very proud of:\n\nIn Methods in Ecology and Evolution: Kim et al.¬†(2022) ‚ÄúImplementing GitHub Actions continuous integration to reduce error rates in ecological data collection‚Äù\nIn Nature: Dow et al.¬†(2022) ‚ÄúWarm springs alter timing but not total growth of temperate deciduous trees‚Äù\n\nThis coming year, I will be teaching SDS 390 Ecological Forecasting and SDS 410 Capstone in the fall and SDS 220 Intro Stats in the spring.\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nThis year was great between teaching two flavors of Machine Learning, SDS 293: Modeling for ML and CSC 294: Computational ML, before heading off to London for my sabbatical at King‚Äôs College London working with Prof.¬†Elaine Chew and her COSMOS team. It was such a great experience to work with Prof.¬†Chew and her group, and I‚Äôm excited to bring back new collaborations and projects for Smithies to work on!\nThe big news out of my TInKER Lab is that our first big project was published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS): repytah: An Open-Source Python Package for Building Aligned Hierarchies for Sequential Data. This is joint work with 12 Smithies: Chenhui Jia, Lizette Carpenter, Thu Tran, Amanda Y. Liu, Sasha Yeutseyeva, Marium Tapal, Yingke Wang, Zoie Kexin Zhao, Jordan Moody, Denise Nava, Eleanor Donaher, Lillian Yushu Jiang, and Ben Bruncati.\nThis coming fall, I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing everyone back on campus and teaching the new CSC 110.\n\n\nRebecca Kurtz-Garcia\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nYear three at Smith was my favorite so far, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed seeing all the traditions come back in full force! The past year has been full of collaborations with students, and I had my first opportunity to take Smithies with me to the Midwest Political Science Association Conference.\nThis past Spring, I was able to start up the State Politics Lab through the Humanities and Social Science Lab program on campus. This lab focuses on tracking state legislatures across the American states to see what policy networks are forming. In particular, we are currently tracking laws around LGBT topics and are looking to collaborate with journalists and activists to get a better understanding of why some states pass restrictions and others do not. We are in the middle of data collection right now, but plan on starting to analyze the data this Fall and present our work. This research lies at the intersection of Government and Data Science, so please reach out if you are interested in joining our team this Fall. My reserach is continuing to focus on how public opinion is translated into policy across the states, and using network analysis to study how states are influenicng each other.\nThis upcoming year, I will be teaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220) in the Fall, as well as The Politics of Public Policy (GOV 207) for the Government department. I will be on sabbatical in the Spring, but will be around campus.\n\n\nLindsay Poirier"

While the time I spend coding is becoming less and less, I‚Äôm deeply enjoying my work at the intersection of data and electoral politics. Otherwise, I‚Äôm enjoying plenty of time in the kitchen as a hobbyist home-chef and have added many new recipes to my cooking Instagram. Pittsburgh is still home for now, though I have my eyes on Chicago or Philly.\nChrista Chiao ‚Äô15: I am continuing to work in campaign-side electoral politics in data science and data engineering roles. This past year I graduated from the QMSS program at Columbia University and later worked as a Senior Data Scientist at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during the 2022 midterm cycle. I‚Äôm looking forward to electing more Democrats in 2024 and to keep learning about survey research, managing data teams, and more.\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: Year 2 teaching at Bucknell was a busy one! Here are some things I‚Äôm proud of from the year: we released our second Data Science by Design Anthology (‚ÄúOur Environment‚Äù), I developed and taught a new first year seminar ‚ÄúStorytelling with Data‚Äù, I got to give an USCOTS keynote and be on an SDSS panel with superstars Christine Zhang ‚Äô09 (another Smithie, we‚Äôre everywhere) and Roger Peng (I only fangirled a little over his podcasts). I‚Äôm on pre-tenure leave this upcoming school year, so if anyone is in need of a seminar speaker, I‚Äôm up for a travel adventure. :D\n**Liz Stuart ‚Äò97** (math major): I‚Äôve been named Chair of the Biostatistics Department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She would love to welcome more Smith alums to the field and Department! She also is succeeding former Smith faculty member Nick Horton as co-chair of the National Academies‚Äô Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics.\nDana Udwin ‚Äô14: I‚Äôm happy to report that I defended my dissertation in biostatistics and joined the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory as a senior data scientist.\nMaggie Wang ‚Äô20: I start my PhD in political methodology at UChi this fall.

Randi earned her B.A. in psychology and women‚Äôs studies from the University of California, Los Angeles and her Ph.D in social psychology from the University of Connecticut. She also completed an M.S. in statistics at UConn. After graduate school she held a postdoctoral research associate position at Princeton University. Randi‚Äôs current research in small group processes continues to explore how demographic differences and individuals‚Äô identification with their social groups influence psychological group formation. The focus of this work is on finding the contexts that make demographic differences more salient and more potent predictors of a person‚Äôs feelings towards the group in addition to exploring the effects of group composition and identification on the behaviors within these groups.\nSmith is conducting a search for a tenure-track faculty position in SDS for the fall 2017. This will bring the program‚Äôs permanent staffing level to 3.0 FTE (new person, Baumer, and 50% of Garcia and Halvorsen) in addition to the two MassMutual Faculty Fellows (Crouser and McNamara).\nR. Jordan Crouser ‚Äô08 has received two grants from the U.S. Department of Defense totaling more than $100,000. These research projects include:\n\n‚ÄúTheoretical Models of Human-Machine Interaction in Streaming Analysis Contexts.‚Äù\n‚ÄúA Survey of Visual Analytics Tools for Effective Decision-Making.‚Äù\n\nBen Baumer shared the Contemporary Baseball Analysis Award for his article ‚ÄúOpenWAR: An Open Source System for Evaluating Overall Player Performance in Major League Baseball,‚Äù which appeared in the June 2015 edition of the Journal of Quantitative Analysis.\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI‚Äôm continuing to build my ‚Äúthree-legged stool‚Äù consisting of sports analytics, statistics and data science education, and network science. This past year I wrote a widely-read article for ESPN.com about the state of analytics in baseball, had a paper on our data science course published in The American Statistician, and completed a paper on graph labelling with the help of Yijin Wei ‚Äô16 that will be published in Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory. Right now I‚Äôm trying to finish a textbook on data science using R. After serving as Director of SDS for two years and I am happy to hand over that responsibility to Joe O‚ÄôRourke of the computer science department. SDS is the fastest-growing department at Smith and there is still much work to be done as we launch our official major! Here is a recent picture of my daughter eating a cheese wheel (couldn‚Äôt resist):\n\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\nis beginning his second year as a Visiting Assistant Professor and MassMutual Faculty Fellow in the Statistical and Data Sciences Program. His research interests are Human-Computer Interaction and Visual Analytics, with a focus on human computation and human-computer teams. With the support of an incredible team of SEVEN undergraduate research assistants, work in the Human Computation and Visualization Laboratory is rapidly gaining speed. New this summer: Jordan and his team have begun a collaboration with practitioners in Community-Based Mental Health! In this project, we explore how computational tools might help provide more equitable access to services, as well as how insights from the field might help computer scientists better understand how humans think.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nis a new faculty member joining SDS and Psychology this Fall. She is interested in the analysis of nested data from pairs and groups of people including when those measurements are taken overtime. Her research in psychology investigates the effects of race and gender in interpersonal encounters. Specifically, she is interested in the effects of sexual objectification and how are attitudes about race affect interracial friendships. Randi is looking forward to teaching statistics in the SDS department next spring!\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nWe expanded our statistics and data science electives through the new program in Statistics and Data Sciences this year, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to teach a new course in the fall term, ‚ÄúCategorical Data Analysis,‚Äù a 300-level elective for our advanced statistics students. Ten students from Smith, UMass, and Mount Holyoke enrolled in the course. I also taught Research Design in the fall and one section of Introduction to Probability and Statistics (MTH/SDS 220) and its two lab sections in the spring. This summer I am working with a research assistant on a project looking at financial investment strategies from a statistical perspective. Our hope for this project is to develop some new options for student projects in MTH/SDS 220.\nI also serve on the Mathematics Academic Advisory Committee of the College Board and continue to direct the MWM Program for the American Statistical Association (ASA). MWM provides a workshop for high school and middle school teachers to learn to teach the statistics in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, and the ASA sponsors MWM each year at the Joint Statistics Meetings in August.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\njust completed her first year as a visiting assistant professor in the Statistical and Data Sciences program. She was happy to return to a liberal arts setting (her BA is from Macalester College, where she double-majored in English and math) and loved all the bright, curious students. In April, she gave a talk called ‚ÄúDo you know Nothing when you see it?‚Äù at Bocoup‚Äôs OpenVisConf. This summer, she is balancing research with travel to a number of conferences and workshops.\nAs an incoming TIER fellow, she will be attending a workshop on reproducible research at Haverford College, followed by a workshop on teaching R at Pomona College, and the R user‚Äôs conference, useR!, at Stanford University. Later in the summer she will attend the SIAM annual meeting in Boston, Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago and the Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit at UC Berkeley."

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nI can say with certainty‚Äîwhich is rare in our discipline‚Äîthat the 2020‚Äì2021 academic year was the most difficult for the faculty in‚Ä¶who knows how long? We all adapted our pedagogy to remote instruction and settled in for the long haul of a year of Zoom meetings and online classes. My heart goes out to Sara Stoudt ‚Äô15, who accepted a one-year teaching position and then never got to set foot in her office or in a Smith classroom!\nIt was nevertheless an eventful year for faculty:\n\nMiles Ott ‚Äô01 was granted tenure and promotion to associate professor in February. To our great sadness, Miles resigned his position at the end of the year to become a Senior Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson. We wish Miles all the best in his new line of work and will miss him dearly.\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15 accepted a tenure-track position at Bucknell University. We‚Äôre thrilled for Sara and look forward to collaborating with her.\nWe hired Lindsay Poirier as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistics and data science. Lindsay is a data anthropologist who comes to us from UC-Davis. We‚Äôre super-excited about the breadth of new course offerings she will offer and the experience she brings to the Program.\nWe hired Fatou Sanogo as a Lecturer. Fatou just completed her PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. She‚Äôll be teaching mostly introductory statistics and we are lucky to have her here as she starts her career.\nWe‚Äôll be searching for three tenure-track positions this year!\n\na biostatistician\na 2nd MassMutual assistant professor position\na joint position to be shared with the Mathematics department for a Mathematical Statistician\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nIt was a hard year to be Chair! We never even had the chance to celebrate my tenure decision before the pandemic threw us all into a tailspin. I‚Äôm grateful to my family and my colleagues for their perseverance through all the challenges we faced.\nWe finished the 2nd edition of Modern Data Science with R. There are some interesting things starting to come out of the DSC-WAV project, which now entering its 3rd year. In particular, we‚Äôve been tracking how some of the software development practices (e.g., GitHub and Scrum) we‚Äôve been implementing with students have fared in the remote working environment.\nI continue to be in awe of the resilience of Smithies (and their general fabulous-ness)!\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis year was full of ups and downs for me‚Ä¶and for many others it seems. In the fall (after pivoting my research questions due to the COVID shut down!) I successfully collected daily-diary data for a research project investigating household and childcare labor among cohabitating couples with at least one person working from home. It was exciting to start analyzing this data set with my students in my Spring 2021 research seminar. We have some interesting results that we‚Äôll be writing up for publication together! In addition, this year I had a paper written with Sarah Bingham ‚Äô22 on Instagram use and self-objectification accepted for publication in Psychology of Popular Media and I submitted a paper written with Kat Kyuchukova ‚Äô19, Asha Hinson ‚Äô19, and Lanee Jung ‚Äô20 on objectification in interactions among women for publication.\nAfter a Spring 2020 sabbatical and a Fall 2020 course release, I had my first remote teaching experience teaching SDS 290 during J-term this year. Shout out to Julie Destine ‚Äô21 and Audrey Bertin ‚Äô21 ‚Äî I simply could not have taught this crazy face-paced J-term course without your assistance and swift grading! And shout out to all of my J-term students for working so hard. It was a pleasure to have that experience with you! In the Spring I taught my Psychology of Women and Gender course and my Research Seminar. It was nice to find that I was still able to build relationships with my students, and to help them build community with each other, even in the remote environment. But I‚Äôm definitely ready to get back in the classroom!\nI read lots of classic books this year including Pride and Prejudice, the Harry Potter series, Dune, and the Golden Compass series. All for the very first time! I am currently reading the Lord or the Rings: Two Towers. I also read The Fate of Food and Braiding Sweetgrass which was amazing ‚Äî thanks to Ester Zhao ‚Äô21 for the recommendation! There was also a lot of Nintendo playing and gardening in my life.\n\n\nWill Hopper\nThis fall, I‚Äôll be returning to teach my greatest hits, SDS 201 (Statistical Methods for Undergraduates) and SDS 291 (Multiple Regression). I‚Äôm most excited to adapt some ideas and methods for creating a more interactive lecture experience, inspired by the experience of teaching online, to the physical classroom. Oddly enough, I‚Äôve taught more semesters online than in-person, so in some ways returning to campus will be the strange adaptation, rather than the other way around! Regardless of locale, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll continue to be impressed by the tenacity and commitment of the students in my classes.\nI continued to enjoy playing competitive Pok√©mon in the VGC format, and I even won my first prize money (well, $24, but still, it‚Äôs something!). I‚Äôm enjoying the current series 10 ruleset, and looking forward to the upcoming Diamond/Pearl remakes coming this fall. Pok√©mon is a game full of probabilities, so expect a few examples if you‚Äôre taking one of my classes!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello SDS world! It being my sabbatical year, I taught a single course in the fall: SDS 390 Ecological Forecasting. It was among the most rewarding teaching experiences of my career. Despite the remote circumstances, I felt like I had a chance to really bond with every student in the class. Not only did we apply data science tools and technology to answer ecological questions, but we also discussed larger topics like time-management, healthy work-life balance, and interpersonal skills in workplace settings.\nOn the research side of things, my work in forest ecology has been getting curiouser and curiouser. Here are three projects I‚Äôve been involved in:\n\nStudying the growth phenology of trees i.e.¬†how year-to-year changes in within-year climate variation is impacting the growth of trees. We found evidence that suggests even though growing seasons are getting longer (springs that start earlier and falls that end later), this is not translating to increased tree growth :(\nUsing Bayesian Hidden Markov Models to fuse disparate sources of tree data into a single model with the ultimate goal of forecasting the growth of trees.\nImplementing GitHub Actions continuous integration cyberinfrastructure to automate quality assurance and control of data on forest dynamics. The basic pipeline is: ecologists gather data in the field and then push the resulting spreadsheets to GitHub. This will then trigger data scripts that will automatically verify data quality and produce a dashboard of reports.\n\nOther than than during this year of COVID I‚Äôve been playing a lot of tennis, fell into a Nintendo Switch Zelda Breath of the Wild wormhole for most of late December and January, and been doing a lot of soul-searching as a result of the anti-Asian hate crimes that occurred in Atlanta in March. Lastly, my beloved Montreal Canadiens made it to the NHL Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since I was 12 years old. Despite an odds-defying run to the finals, they lost in 5 games to the repeat champion Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nWith both teaching and conferences all virtual, this year was like no other for sure! In the spring, I taught two different machine learning classes: Modeling for Machine Learning (SDS 293) and Computational Machine Learning (CSC 294). It was great to gather and work through the details of various Machine Learning concepts.\nSince last newsletter, I once again was a co-organizer for the Women In Music Information Retrieval Workshop and for the Machine Learning for Media Discovery Workshop. I had a lot of fun working with collaborators this year. Automatic Hierarchy Expansion for Improved Structure and Chord Evaluation with Brian McFee expands on our ISMIR 2019 paper. It was also fun to integrate my interests in MIR and pedagogy in Interactive Learning of Signal Processing Through Music: Making Fourier Analysis Concrete for Students with Meinard Mueller and Brian McFee. This summer, I‚Äôve been privileged to work with five students through the SURF program, which is a great way to wrap up this year of virtual collaboration\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nAfter my first year virtual teaching, I‚Äôm so excited to finally be teaching in person and getting to participate in some Smithie traditions this Fall (I‚Äôve been promised donuts). This Fall, I will be teaching my first dual prefixed course, SDS/GOV 338 Political Networks, and I look forward building more connections between GOV ad SDS.\nI used the pandemic as an excuse to explore every trail and state park I can with my dog, Gollum. Say hi if you see us walking around campus and I‚Äôm always looking for new trail recommendations! In the past year I have finished an upcoming book with Karen Mossberger and Caroline Tolbert on the importance of broadband for state and local economic and political development, and was honored to receive the best dissertation award from the State Politics and Policy Section of the American Political Science Association. I also have published papers in State Politics and Policy Quarterly, Politics Research Quarterly, and my first solo-authored publication in Social Science Quarterly.\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nI am so thrilled to be joining the faculty in SDS at Smith! Last month, I road-tripped across the country from Sacramento, CA where I was an Assistant Professor at UC Davis in a program called Science and Technology Studies (STS). STS is a social science discipline that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. Many of the courses that I will be teaching at Smith (such as Data Ethnography and Data and Social Justice) approach data science from this angle.\nAs if I wasn‚Äôt excited enough for my start day at Smith, that same day an article I‚Äôve been working on for a year and half was published in the journal Big Data and Society. It describes how I‚Äôve taught students to perform critical readings of datasets like the NYPD‚Äôs Stop, Question, and Frisk dataset and the EPA‚Äôs Toxic Release Inventory. This year I also published in the Journal of Cultural Studies, co-published in the Science and Technology Studies journal, and collaborated with some amazing students and colleagues on the development of public interest databases and mapping tools. I can‚Äôt wait to bring Smith students on to some of these projects. I spent most evenings in 2021 cooking, working on mosaic projects, and attempting to match the energy of my spunky pup Maddie. Like me, she‚Äôs loving life here in Northampton!\n\n\nFatou Sanogo\nI am excited to be joining the SDS program as a lecturer for the year! I just finished my PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) this summer and I am looking forward to teaching intro stats and Modeling for Machine Learning at Smith.\nI have lived in Birmingham since I first came to the US back in 2013 and this will be a big move for me. I can‚Äôt wait to start this new adventure at Smith :) I am planning on a 3 days road trip from Birmingham to Northampton which should be fun!"

I govern the data quality and data flow across multiple electronic medical record (EMR) systems among a range of commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare value-based care programs, contributing to a deep knowledge of data integration in and out of EMRs. I have enjoyed working on an executive-level, overseeing the data for a multi-hospital network and providing usable data visualizations to leadership. In the meantime, I have been finishing up my master‚Äôs degree in Clinical and Translational Research from George Washington University and will officially conclude by the end of next month! I am currently working on my master‚Äôs capstone project with Randy Frost, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and it has been truly fabulous to reconnect especially over an interesting study! In my free time (what is that again?), I have been busy enjoying life with my 3.5 year old twins and husband, continuing my role as the head of the Smith Alumnae Admissions for the tri-state area, appreciating my role on the Board of the Smith College Club of Baltimore, and have been progressing in my role as Treasurer on the Smith Class of 2015 Cabinet.\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: I spent the year teaching other Smithies! My favorite activity was making ‚Äúdata phys‚Äù to help visualizations come to life off our screens. Another highlight of the year was the release of Deb Nolan and my book, Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science. Check it out!. Now I‚Äôm off to my next adventure at Bucknell University where I‚Äôll start as an Assistant Professor in the fall.\nKara Van Allen ‚Äô20: I moved to Somerville just over a year ago and started working as a Litigation Analyst for a market research firm in Waltham. While I have enjoyed it as my first job after Smith, I am ready for my next adventure, hopefully one with a stronger statistics focus. I would love any and all support or leads from my Smith network!"

    "text": "Faculty Updates\n\nRandi Garcia was promoted to associate professor with tenure!\nFatou Sanogo got a tenure-track job at Bates! We‚Äôre wishing Fatou all the best in her next steps.\nWe hired Kaitlyn Cook as a tenure-track assistant professor. Kaitlyn is a biostatistician coming from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where she completed her doctorate and a postdoc. Her research focuses on methodological development for cluster-correlated and interval-censored data, with a particular emphasis on applications to cluster-randomized HIV (or other infectious disease) prevention studies. Kaitlyn will be teaching a range of statistics courses and may choose to join the steering committee for the new interdepartmental major in Mathematical Statistics (MST).\nWe hired Shiya Cao as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistical and data sciences. Shiya comes to us from WPI, where she completed her PhD in Information Technology. Her research focuses on disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics. Shiya will be teaching SDS 192 and SDS 100 in her first year.\nWe hired Jared Joseph as a visiting assistant professor for the next two years. Jared just completed his PhD in sociology at UC-Davis. His research uses computational techniques and civic data to uncover patterns of behavior that are otherwise unseen. For example, political networks of prohibition gangsters and bias hidden in the text of academic recruitment. Jared will be teaching SDS 192 an application domain course in his first year.\nWe‚Äôll be searching for two tenure-track positions this year, both of which are joint with other departments!\n\na joint position with the Mathematical Sciences department for a mathematical statistician\n\na joint position with the Physics department for a computational physicist\n\n\n\nBen Baumer\nThis past year was transitional for me and the department. We‚Äôve brought on a number of outstanding junior faculty members, while also tenuring Randi Garcia! We now have a plan of succession, as Randi has been elected the future Chair of SDS, to start July 2023, when I leave for a full-year sabbatical.\nThis year I continued to oversee the DSC-WAV project, which is now entering its final year. We published two papers related to this work, a short one in the Harvard Data Science Review and a longer one in Foundations of Data Science. AS part of these efforts I‚Äôm working on creating transfer pathways in data science from two-year to four-year colleges in Massachusetts. My collaborators and I also published our thoughts on the tidyverse.\nI‚Äôm excited to begin the new year with new colleagues!\n\n\nShiya Cao\nThis year‚Äôs keywords for me included new and transition. As a newly minted Ph.D., I am looking forward to continuing to conduct disability inclusion and broader social inclusion research and engaging Smithies in these research projects. My doctoral dissertation focused on the critical view of the design of information systems to improve the workplace accommodation process for disabled employees. An initial version was co-published at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in 2022. I also conducted digital accessibility research regarding data-based decision making to integrate accessibility guidelines into college curricula, which was co-published at Behavior & Information Technology in 2021. I also have a forthcoming coauthored book chapter titled ‚ÄúThe Chains that Bind: Gender, Disability, Race, and IT Accommodations‚Äù. I am excited to further explore these research areas with Smithies and help them pay attention to human, social, and emotional elements of data science.\nI also can‚Äôt wait to start teaching at Smith! I will be teaching SDS 192 and SDS 100 this Fall. I taught an Introduction to Data Science course at WPI for five terms and developed course content including statistics lectures, data visualization labs, programming and machine learning tutorials, assignments, and quizzes. However, there are still things for me to learn with new materials, new platforms, new tools, and new students. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to evolve my teaching strategies, ideas, and philosophies as I grow alongside my students.\nAnother new thing for me is that I have moved from Central MA to Western MA. This is the first time I have lived in the countryside. I love nature and seeing so much green. However, again, I have many new things to learn, such as gardening, living in harmony with bears. Life is full of adventure. Keep learning, keep improving. I am excited to start my new journey here with great colleagues and great students.\n\n\nKaitlyn Cook\nI‚Äôm incredibly honored and excited to be joining the Statistics and Data Science Program at Smith! I‚Äôm coming to Northampton by way of Boston, MA, where I‚Äôve lived for the last seven years: first as a biostatistics graduate student at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and then as a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. My research focuses on statistical methods development for clinical trials with (a) cluster randomization schemes, wherein entire groups of individuals (such as families, schools, or communities) are collectively assigned to a particular treatment arm, and (b) time-to-event endpoints, where a ‚Äútime-to-event‚Äù endpoint might be something like the time from study enrollment to COVID-19 infection or the time to progression from HIV to AIDS. I published a paper on this topic in Biometrics this past August (a preprint is available here for those who are interested!) and have spent the last year working on both a pediatric sleep medicine trial and a COVID-19 treatment/prevention trial. I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing this research while at Smith, as well as to teaching Probability (MTH 246) and Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220) this fall!\nOutside of the classroom, I dedicate myself to watching (too much) reality TV‚Äîthis past winter I managed to watch all 19 seasons of Top Chef over the course of two and a half months, though sadly without any noticeable improvement in my own culinary skills‚Äîand am also an avid reader, an avid Zumba-er, and a sometimes runner.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nThis past Fall semester marked a returned to the classroom! I cannot express how good it felt to get back in there and see all of my students faces (well, half of their faces). Although masking and still being very much in a global pandemic came with challenges, just being in the same room with everyone was amazing. In SDS 290 Design and Analysis I switched textbooks and continued having students design their own individual experiments‚Äîan assignment I adopted for remote teaching which I‚Äôm happy to have carried over into the in-person course. I also taught (a full semester of) SDS 291 Multiple Regression for the first time! It was nice to get to know this smaller group of students of the course of the semester. My research group continued working on the daily-diary data investigating household and childcare labor among cohabitating couples.\nIn the Spring semester I worked with a great group of students on the DSC-WAV project. They continued work started by a group at Amherst College creating an equity dashboard for the SPIFFY coallition. My research group analyzed data on a project investigating self-objectification and Zoom use. We hope to submit this research report for publication this summer. I am honored to have received the 2022 Mu Sigma Rho Early Career Undergraduate Impact Award! This award is very meaningful to me as recognition of my work mentoring students in SDS over the years.\nThe Spring semester also brought two very important pieces of great news for me: 1) I received tenure, and 2) I learned that I‚Äôm expecting a baby a September!! I feel so honored to become a permanent member of the faculty at an institution I love. Stay tuned for news on the baby in next year‚Äôs newsletter.\n\n\nWill Hopper\n\n\nJared Joseph\nThis Fall will bring many exciting changes for me as I start my first year at Smith. I‚Äôm moving from the West to East coast, progressing from student to professor, and shifting titles from sociologist to data scientist. I see each of these changes as an opportunity to bring the best of my experiences to a new venue.\nBridging the gap between the social and data sciences has always been a passion of mine, and I look forward to continuing to do so in my instruction. As I prepare to teach Introduction to Data Science (SDS 192), I look forward to highlighting the human element in the data we use, and hopefully inviting more social scientists to level up their data skills. As a recent student in the social sciences, I can remember the initial hurdles of reaching beyond my comfort zone, but can also speak to the major ways it has improved my work, and my life in general. As I prepare for this work, I hope to learn more about my new home, as it‚Äôs my first time living in this part of the world.\nIn addition to my teaching, I‚Äôll be focusing on translating my dissertation into publications. I studied how asset forfeiture (basically police seizing private property) is used in California over the past two decades, and the impact such power has on law enforcement actions. I recently got the news that the first paper from this project has been accepted for publication (more details soon). I‚Äôve got 2 more papers planned from this project! For now I get to enjoy the most fun part of the research process (in my opinion), deciding what my next big question will be.\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello SDS world! A lot has been going! First, my forest ecology research started to take off. On top of continuing my work with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal VA, I‚Äôve started new collaborations with Harvard Forest in nearby Petersham MA. My collaborators and I have been putting the finishing touches on two big papers about this work, standby! Second, in Fall 2022, SDS 192 Intro to Data Science had a whopping 121 students registered; by far the largest number of students I‚Äôve had! While having this many students presented many new challenges, it was still a rewarding experience; having the Spinelli tutoring center provide both in-class data assistants and evening drop-in tutoring made this possible. Next, I also very much enjoyed acting as the faculty liaison to the SDS Coalition of Color, who this past academic year got officially chartered as an SGA organization. Lastly, but most importantly, my wife and I welcomed the birth of our first child, Georgina ‚ÄúGigi‚Äù Jeewon Kim! Baby Gigi‚Äôs interests include making deep baritone burps and listening to baby lullaby renditions of Guns n‚Äô Roses songs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\nSeason three of the pandemic was another year like no other. It was great to be back on campus with students chatting about statistics and machine learning. This past fall, I was a co-organizer for the Teaching ML workshop which included a talk by Prof.¬†Alicia Johnson, collaborator and co-author of Miles Ott ‚Äô01. (Our next workshop is in September; join us!) I‚Äôve continued working with students on my collaborative NSF TRIPODS+X grant during the academic year and to work virtually with four students through SURF.\nI‚Äôm teaching both Modeling for Machine Learning (SDS 293) and Computational Machine Learning(CSC294) this fall. Then I‚Äôll be on sabbatical in the spring. Looking forward to seeing everyone again this fall!\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm beginning my third year at Smith and was so grateful to be able to see and work with student during the last academic year. I have particularly enjoyed working with students on creating a new database of racial disparities in state-level population health outcomes.\nIn this last year, my co-authored book titled Choosing the Future: Technology and Opportunity in Communities came out, where we explore the political and economic effects of broadband in counties and cities across the United States. I‚Äôve also continued my research on public policy in the American states, and hope to continue working with students to think critically about the data generating process.\nThis upcoming year, I will be teaching two courses for the Government department in the Fall (Gov 200 and GOV 306) and in the Spring will be teaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics (SDS 220) as well as a seminar in Network analysis in Political Science (SDS/GOV 338- which will count towards your application domain!)\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nWhat a whirlwind of a first year at Smith! It has been such a joy and a privilege getting to know Smith students and colleagues, and I can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs in store in the coming years.\nThis year I launched the Data Ethnography and Advocacy Lab - a research group focused on investigating the cultural histories of public interest datasets in the United States. A number of exceptional Smith students have helped get this lab off the ground! Based on this work, I published a paper in the conference proceedings for ACM FAccT. The paper highlights a number of concerns around the representativeness and usefulness of ‚Äúdisclosure datasets,‚Äù or datasets aggregated from information produced by the same institutions the data is meant to hold accountable. I also published a book chapter in the Handbook for the Anthropology of Technology, detailing the knowledge practices engaged as the EPA works to develop nationwide vehicle emissions estimates. In March, five Smithies (Amrita Acharya, Sena Amuzu, Lara Brown, Juniper Huang, Naomi Liftman, and Molly Zelloe) came with me down to NYC School of Data to present a workshop to NYC civic technologists and city staff on how to examine and narrate the cultural backstories of datasets. I also brought an anthropologist‚Äôs perspective to a panel assessing ‚Äú20 Years of Data Science‚Äù at International Data Week this past June.\nIn the Fall, I‚Äôll be teaching Data and Social Justice (SDS 189) and Introduction to Data Science (SDS 192), and in the Spring, I‚Äôll be teaching Data Ethnography (SDS 237) and Capstone in Statistical & Data Sciences (SDS 410). I hope you‚Äôve soaked up the best of summer, and looking forward to seeing you very soon!"

I‚Äôm really enjoying all the learning in my new role, and helping researchers with exciting projects. In my spare time, I enjoy biking around the bay area, going on gorgeous hikes, and spending time with my cat.\nLizzy (Atkins) Offermann ‚Äô15: Life has been busy over the last year in the Offermann household! I graduated with my master‚Äôs degree in Clinical and Translational Research from George Washington University, changed jobs and now work for an amazing healthcare tech company aiming to make healthcare more accessible for everyone, have continued my work as the Treasurer for the Class of 2015 Cabinet, and recently finished up a busy admissions season as the Smith Club of Baltimore‚Äôs Alumnae Admission Coordinator for the tri-state area. Some major professional highlights involve working on all of the data for my company‚Äôs COVID-19 Antiviral Treatment Programs across multiple states in the US, our ship-to-home preventative care kit, and most recently our partnership with the CDC and White House to make COVID-19 testing more accessible! My involvement with these three projects and others ranges from data ingestion from the UI, data wrangling, modeling, database creation, analytics, visualization, and working with the customers and stakeholders to fully understand the story their data is telling them. We have open positions on my team and other fabulous teams at Color, so if you are looking to get into healthcare tech - reach out!\nPersonally, our twin toddlers are getting closer and closer to turning 5 years old and entering public school - wild how time flies! My husband and I just love to watch them grow, learn, and form into their own little people with full personalities. We have been very thankful to avoid COVID so far and the kiddos are almost fully vaxxed now, too - fingers crossed we can keep it away until they get their final dose!\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: My first year as an assistant professor at Bucknell University is in the books, and now I‚Äôm gearing up to teach a first-year seminar in the fall on ‚ÄúStorytelling with Data‚Äù. Send me your favorite data stories! Here are some things I‚Äôm proud of this year: for the birders, for the teachers, and for the creatives."

Thank you, Clara and Robin!\nWe hired Kementari Whitcher, Yujie Wang, and Ab Mosca ‚Äô14 who began their positions on July 1.\nAfter completing her first year, Casey Berger is moving on to pursue a tenure-track job in the Physics Department at Bates College. We‚Äôre sad to see Casey go, but excited to see what she does next!\n\n\nBen Baumer\nHola, buenas d√≠as!\nI‚Äôm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical in Medell√≠n, Colombia! It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal. My wife and I took many Spanish classes at Universidad EAFIT, which is a lovely place to study. We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the CEFR framework. I suppose it‚Äôs bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish!\nWhile on sabbatical I was able to complete the 3rd edition of Analyzing Baseball Data with R, and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT. We‚Äôre working on an R package and a paper for changepoint detection algorithms.\n\n\nShiya Cao\nMy second year at Smith is in the books. I continued to work with students in my Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL). I took two Smithies Christy Yang ‚Äô25J and Vicky Xu ‚Äô26 to attend the Women in Statistics and Data Science (WSDS) Conference in Bellevue, WA in Fall 2023.

I have been working with Heather Rosenfeld from the Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL) at Smith on a research project named Mapping for Access on the Smith College Campus: A Participatory Mapping Approach. I have also been collaborating with Keegan Kang, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Bucknell University, on a research project named Model Interpretation after Using Random Projections: An Applied Study on Travel Disability Data.\nMoreover, I am working on publishing my doctoral dissertation, examining information systems-enabled workplace inclusion for disabled employees. One of my dissertation papers is published at the peer-reviewed journal Work: A Journal of Prevention, Assessment & Rehabilitation. I also gave a Sigma Xi talk at Smith in Fall 2023 and another talk for a Statistics II course at Bucknell University in Spring 2024.\nThis year, I continued to teach SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science. In Fall 2023, I developed and taught a research seminar course SDS 300: Disability Inclusion and Data Analytics. In Spring 2024, I taught the senior capstone course SDS 410 and participated in the pedagogical partnerships program with my student pedagogical partner My My Tran ‚Äô24. I had great experiences teaching these courses.\nWhen I had free time, I enjoyed reading books with my book club, practicing piano, seeing movies at Amherst Cinema, and visiting museums. Also, thank you to my colleague Kaitlyn Cook for recommending me the classic American reality TV show ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù! I began to watch Season 1 last summer and am currently at Season 24 (only skipped Seasons 5, 21, and 23), which is a nice way to decompress:)\n\n\nKaitlyn Cook\nThis past year I was excited to develop and teach a new statistics depth course on statistical methods in biostatistics and epidemiology (aptly named ‚ÄúMethods in Biostatistics and Epidemiology‚Äù!). The course blended topics from categorical data analysis and survival analysis with discussions of epidemiological study designs, threats to internal and external study validity, and metrics for quantifying the presence of disease in populations. I also enjoyed teaching MTH 246: Probability for the second time and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. Finally, I was particularly proud to watch my inaugural thesis student, Heng (Silvia) Song ‚Äô24, successfully defend her thesis on ‚ÄúStochastic Processes and their Application in Bayesian Statistics‚Äù, making her the first student to graduate with honors in Mathematical Statistics at Smith! Outside of the classroom, I‚Äôve continued settling into life in the Valley by joining a local run club in Northampton, playing trumpet with the Amherst Community Band, and watching far too much reality TV from my couch.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\n\n\nWill Hopper\nThe 2023-24 academic year had some exciting and fun firsts for me! During the summer, I developed and taught a new course for third-year students in Smith‚Äôs Doctoral Program for Social Work, focused on applying hierarchical regression models and structural equation models to data analysis and research problems in social science settings. During the ‚Äúregular‚Äù academic year, I got to teach SDS 270: Programming for Data Science for the first (and second!) time. Since I typically teach courses focused on the statistics side of the SDS coin, I enjoyed the chance to teach a programming-focused class. Developing and teaching new classes is a lot of work, but it‚Äôs also the most fun part of teaching; a new class is a bit like a blank canvas, and you get to be creative in finding the best way to fill it with what your students need to know.\nThis fall, I‚Äôm looking forward to taking on advisees for the first time, watching the Pokemon World Championships, and teaching SDS 100: Reproducible Computing with Data for the first time!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\n\n\nRebecca Kurtz-Garcia\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nThe last year has been one of many big and exciting changes! Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break. I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke. I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I‚Äôm excited to be back.\nMy sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students. My State Politics Lab has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April. We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans.\nThis upcoming year, I will be teaching my Research Seminar in Political Networks (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching Research Design and Analysis (SDS 290) and Introduction to American Politics (GOV 200) in the Spring.\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nHello SDS friends! This summer, I‚Äôm feeling so grateful that I‚Äôm coming off of a year where I had an opportunity to focus on work that I find both socially important and personally fulfilling. A Spring sabbatical provided me time to really submerge into aspects of my research program. This past February I spent a month in Frankfurt, Germany on a Mercator Fellowship at Goethe University. While I was there, I delivered a number of lectures and workshops on ‚Äúdata ethnography‚Äù and had a chance to work with faculty, post-docs, and graduate students brainstorming how to devise new methods for studying the cultural aspects of data production, circulation, and use. Then in March, with some tremendous collaborators at UCLA, Northeastern University, and Whitman College, I published a paper in the American Journal of Public Health documenting that almost half of US carceral facilities are proximate to sites of contamination by ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù (or PFAS). The paper was covered in The Hill, The Guardian, and supported the development of proposed US legislation for improving environmental health in prisons. Publishing this paper meant a lot to me, both personally and professionally. Sabbatical also granted me some time for more personal pursuits. I‚Äôve been diligently working to improve my French, devising Massachusetts adventures for me and my 2.5-year old niece, and putting some elbow grease into making my new house in South Hadley feel more like a home.\nThis coming year, I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing my research examining the cultural origins of the Open Payments database - anthropologically studying how the professionals responsible for disclosing data about their payments to healthcare providers develop certain accounting and meaning-making strategies in their work. I look forward to continue teaching Data Ethnography in the Fall and Spring, and to offering a new course called Community-Based Data Science in the Spring.\n\n\nKementari Whitcher\n\n\nYujie Wang\n\n\nAb Mosca ‚Äô14"

In pairs: identify two kinds of social connections that you could collect from watching part of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy\nHave students pick which kind of social connection information they will collect\nShow part of the first episode of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy (I showed first 12 minutes) and have students collect the social network information\n\n\n\nQuestions to Ask in Data Collection Discussion:\n\nWhat did you notice as you were collecting the data?\nWas it always obvious that people were or were not connected?\nHow can biases be introduced when collecting social network data? What implications will that have for the conclusions we will make based on the data?\nAssuming that you were a ‚Äúfly on the wall‚Äù instead of watching a TV show, do you have any concerns for collecting these data?\n\n\n\nHomework Portion\n\nRead Hammer (2017) and reflect on the following questions:\n\nHow can you apply the ideas about data ethics from this reading (which is about surveys in general) to social network analysis survey collection? Which ideas carry over to the social network context, which do not?\nDid collecting the Grey‚Äôs Anatomy data bring up ethical concerns? Why or why not?\n\nRead Kolaczyk and Cs√°rdi (2014) (Pages 1-10 and 13-18)\n\nSummarize in your own words the three types of Network Analysis\nUsing Grey‚Äôs Anatomy data as an example: what are potential benefits/harms of conducting these kinds of analyses?\nUse the social network data you collected from watching Grey‚Äôs Anatomy in class to create an adjaceny list, an edge list, an adjacency matrix. What are the advantages and disadvantages of representing your network data in each of these ways?\nHow does the way we represent data about people change how we consider the ethical implications that can be intwined in the collection and analysis of that data?"

In this discussion we will also consider the ethical issues surrounding the use of race/ethnicity data in data science more generally.\n\nFirst, you will work in small groups (groups of ~4). Using the classroom boards, bullet-point your answers to the following three questions pertaining to the article:\n\nWhat did they find?\nHow did they do it?\nWhat is missing or limited?\n\nNext, we will come back together as a group to discuss your answers to these questions. Our discussion of the limitations of this research study will support our discussion about broader issues with the coding and using of race/ethnicity data.\nAfter this initial article discussion, you will work in pairs to try coding raw racial/ethnic identity data. This data comes in both in check-all-that-apply and free response formats. Your task is to create a new categorical variable in the dataset called race_clean. Next, you will discuss in small groups (~4) the choice you made while creating your clean race variable and any thoughts/feelings you had during the task (that you are comfortable sharing with your partner/group)."

The following is a suggested timeline for a 70-minute class session.\n\n(15 minutes): Break the class into four groups. Each group will discuss the following questions pertaining to the assigned article and write their bulletpointed responses on the boards. The first two questions help the students warm up and make sure that everyone understood\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nDiscuss the results resented in the article.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nDiscuss the methods employed by the researchers.\n\nWhat is missing or limited?\n\nDiscuss the limitations of the research study. This piece is where the concerns regarding race are likely to come out.\n\n\nBonus (completed if groups finish early): Make a sketch of the dataset that was used in these analyses. What does each row represent? What variables must it have? What index variables must it have?\n\n(25 minutes): Discuss the three questions as a class. Try to move them quickly through the first two questions to leave about half the time for the third question. I would leave them in suspence with the bonus task‚Äîperhaps start the following class with this as a warm-up activity. As they raise missing pieces and limitations, write their suggestions on the board in a joint class bulletpointed list.\n\n(15 minutes): Now in pairs, have students start cleaning the messy race data provided. Their task is to code the check-all-that-apply and/or free response data into a new categorical variable called race_clean.\n(10 minutes): Back in small groups of four (two pairs), have students discuss the choices they made and feelings they had while re-coding the race/ethnicity data. These feelings reflect the hard realities that researchers must confront in their work.\n(5 minutes): Wrap up. Let students know that this is not the end of the discussion. If they are feeling like they have more questions than answers, or they are more confused about race and ethnicity in data science than when the class began, this is a good thing‚Äîit is a complex issue! You might also remind them that the coding of race and ethnicity in the US is deeply connected to a history of racial oppression. As future data scientists, they can play an active role in creating ethical guidelines for moving towards more appropriate use of race and ethnicity data. It is very important not to skip the wrap up for this activity. Set a timer such that you can touch base with them and ideally, end on a hopeful note."

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nThe SDS faculty continues to grow.\n\nPeter de Villiers of the Psychology department served as SDS Program Chair this past year, and will serve again next year, despite being retired. Thank you Peter for your service to SDS!\nOur search for a joint position with GOV failed last year. Fortunately, we will be searching again this fall. If you know good candidates, please direct them our way!\nAfter four bountiful years, the MassMutual Visiting Assistant Professor positions expired. MassMutual‚Äôs support brought us three years of Amelia McNamara, two years of Jordan Crouser and Lu Lu, and one year of David Rockoff, for which we are eternally grateful.\nWe hired Dhanamalee Bandara as a Visiting Assistant Professor for 2019-2020. Dhanamalee comes to us from the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She has a Ph.D.¬†in Mathematics with a Statistics concentration from Texas Tech University, and will be teaching 291 in the fall. Welcome Dhanamalee!\nWe hired David Rockoff as a Visiting Assistant Professor for another year after his MassMutual appointment ended.\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI‚Äôm coming up for tenure this fall, and working on my dossier over the summer. I‚Äôm also working on a second edition of Modern Data Science with R, which we have converted to R Markdown and will publish simultaneously online and in print, thanks to bookdown. If you come to JSM this year you will have a hard time avoiding me, as I‚Äôll be winning the Waller Education Award from the Section on Statistics Education and the Significant Contributor Award from the Section on Statistics in Sports. Both are great honors and I‚Äôm deeply grateful to those of you who supported my nomination!\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\n[Jordan is away for much of this summer and (Ben thinks) will be on sabbatical in the fall.]\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nI just finished my third year at Smith and it‚Äôs so exciting to see how much the SDS program has grown since I arrived! This year I got to teach 17 Smith students Structural Equation Modeling in SDS 390. I also continued to expand the client-partner relationships in SDS 290, Research Design and Analysis, teaching the course for a second time in Spring 2019. Thirty-five students in SDS 290 conducted 10 extremely cool experimental studies with the Museum of Art, the Executive Education office, and again with the Botanic Garden. This year I gave two talks about the SDS program, the first at JSM in Vancouver on the many pathways through the SDS major, and in May I spoke at NESS about integrating real-world projects into a modern design course. I also published a book chapter on data analysis strategies for relationship research in an edited volume titled New Directions in the Psychology of Close Relationships. I am proud to receive one of the 2019 the Sherrerd Prizes for distinguished teaching‚Äìceremony upcoming in October 2019. Lastly, I am looking forward to a sabbatical in Spring 2020!\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nI‚Äôve spent the past academic year teaching statistics, Design of Experiments and Categorical Data Analysis, at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. Middlebury is a small, coeducational, liberal arts college with about 2500 students. Middlebury, Vermont, is a small New England town of about 8500 residents chartered in 1761, and located in the Champlain Valley. The area is very rural and has lots of farms for both beef and dairy cattle. It also has several historical sites including the Hubbardton Battlefield where the only battle held in Vermont during the revolutionary war occurred in July of 1777. We also toured the site of the American encampment at Fort Independence, just across the lake from Fort Ticonderoga, both of which were American fortifications during the war and were abandoned shortly before the British sailed down Lake Champlain. One of my happy accomplishments was hiking the TAM, the Trail Around Middlebury, an 18-mile trail that encircles the village of Middlebury. I‚Äôm looking forward to being back at Smith in the fall and teaching Design and Categorical again.\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\nHello everyone, I‚Äôve just completed my first year at Smith and I‚Äôm thrilled to be calling SDS home. It‚Äôs been an eventful year, in particular attending the Women in Statistics & Data Science conference with Prof.¬†Miles Ott and being lead organizer for Five College DataFest. I‚Äôm looking forward to year two!\n\n\nKatie Kinnaird\nI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve completed my first year at Smith; what a whirlwind this year has been! I got to teach four (new to me) courses in two departments, from Communicating with Data to a senior seminar in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The students in MIR having a paper accepted through peer-review to the anniversary track at this year‚Äôs International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference in the Netherlands. I am so thrilled by their paper and cannot wait to see them present in November. This year also took me overseas and around the country, attending ISMIR in Paris, the Women In Machine Learning (WiML) Workshop in Montreal, SDSS Conference in Seattle, and giving talks at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and at the College of the Holy Cross. While this year was the beginning of my time at Smith, it also was my last year as President of the WiML Executive Board. Even though my term is over, my commitment to build more inclusive machine learning and MIR communities will continue. I‚Äôm so lucky to be part of SDS and am grateful for my amazing colleagues and students!\n\n\nMiles Ott\nSo many wonderful things happened this year! I had fun teaching a class on my research area: Statistical Analysis of Social Network Data, as well as Probability, Mathematical Statistics, and Intro Stats 201. I am continuing to work on Respondent Driven Sampling, LGBT Health, and methods for Social Network Interventions in my research. I am getting a bit more involved in efforts to make Stats and Data Science more inclusive for LGBTQ+ folks. I attended both WSDS and SDSS conferences for the first time, and I thought that they both were excellent, welcoming, and fun. I highly recommend them both! Best of all, I started working with wonderful new colleagues Albert Y. Kim, Katie Kinnaird, Dave Rockoff, and Jenny Smetzer.\n\n\nDavid Rockoff\nI just finished my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Smith, having taught Intro Stats and Communicating With Data. This summer I will give a short course on Survival Analysis for MassMutual. I am very excited to be sticking around for another year, during which I will develop a special topics course in educational measurement.\n\n\nJenny Smetzer\nI just completed my first year as Laboratory Instructor in SDS and Psychology. I love teaching the intro stats labs, and very much look forward to teaching next year! This year I published peer-reviewed research articles in the ‚ÄúThe Auk‚Äù ‚Äì a top ornithology journal ‚Äì and in ‚ÄúEcological Modeling‚Äù, and presented research at the Acadia National Park Science Symposium. This year I also continued an ongoing research collaboration with the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center modeling climate change refugia for species of regional conservation concern. This summer I am traveling to Maine for an intensive science communication training at the Schoodic Institute, and to lead two stakeholder workshops to help conservation managers incorporate climate change refugia data products into management plans. After the whirlwind trip to Maine, I am looking forward to the birth of a new baby boy in early September!"

In July, I will be joining the Department of Statistics at University of California Irvine as Assistant Professor of Teaching. I had many opportunities reconnecting with Smithies. In September, I took my students to Amherst College for StatFest where Portia Exum (Parker) ‚Äô10 was a panelist. Emily Dodwell ‚Äô11 was also in the Valley to give a talk for the SDS department. In October, I attended Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference in Cincinnati where I met Dr.¬†Miles Ott ‚Äô01 (side note: he now is a prof. at Smith, see above for his update in case you missed it). Dr.¬†Alicia Johnson of Macalester College, Dr.¬†Ott, and I now collaborate on a Bayesian Statistics textbook for undergraduate students that is going to be published by CRC. I organized Denison‚Äôs first DataFest. In May, I attended my tenth year reunion at Smith. I connected with friends and faculty and met graduating seniors at the SDS reception. I also ran into Dr.¬†Elizabeth Stuart ‚Äô97 during Friday Tea in the Cloud. I enjoy (online and offline) connections with Smithies who are in Statistical and Data Sciences and am looking forward to making new ones in the future.\nWencong (Priscilla) Li ‚Äô18: I went back to watch the 2019 commencement and was happy to see that the SDS department is growing!\nJordan Menter ‚Äô16: In May I finished the last year of the Data Science Development Program at MassMututal, concluding three years of full-time work as a junior data scientist and part-time graduate study in computer science at UMass Amherst. I‚Äôm still waiting for my diploma to come in the mail, but in the meantime I‚Äôve accepted a data scientist role at MM. We recently welcomed the sixth cohort of the DSDP - they‚Äôre wicked smart, and it‚Äôs so exciting to see so much energy and engagement from them.\nThis fall I hope to submit a paper on algorithmic fairness and causality that I worked on as part of my MS degree, supervised by Professor David Jensen at UMass Amherst. I was also lucky enough to take an ethics and computing course last fall, and will be part of a group-level collaboration among myself, Professor Michelle Trim (also at UMass Amherst), and some of my classmates (all of whom were or are also in the DSDP!) to produce a data science and ethics publication of some sorts (a brief textbook, or a reader for a course, or a co-authored paper‚Ä¶). I feel very lucky to have experiences in the research side of things, in addition to the work I do in industry.\nFinally, I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed mentoring current Smith senior and SDS major Starry Zhou ‚Äô20. It‚Äôs wonderful to have connections back to the department, and I‚Äôm excited to see what the future holds for SDS!\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: I made it through another year in the PhD with (hopefully) only one more to go. This year I became a Berkeley Institute for Data Science Fellow and got to help organize a ‚ÄúFostering diverse and inclusive data science at Berkeley‚Äù series for underrepresented undergraduate students. Professor Deb Nolan and I are are finishing up our book on how to write about data and are hoping to have it out in the spring. I‚Äôm spending the summer at the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, living the glamorous data journalist life. :D\nDana Udwin ‚Äô14: I passed the qualifying exam! The plan for the summer is to resume research with Professor Crawford and stress a little less."

While many teaching resources exist for data analysis, such resources are not as abundant for data collection given the inherent difficulty of the task. Our proposed exercise centers around student use of Google Calendar to collect data with the goal of answering the question ‚ÄòHow do I spend my time?‚Äô On the one hand, the exercise involves answering a question with near universal appeal, but on the other hand, the data collection mechanism is not beyond the reach of a typical undergraduate student. A further benefit of the exercise is that it provides an opportunity for discussions on ethical questions and considerations that data providers and data analysts face in today‚Äôs age of large-scale internet-based data collection."

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nAm I eligible for Departmental Honors in SDS or MST?\n\nPlease see the College‚Äôs policies on departmental honors theses.\n\nWhat characterizes an SDS thesis?\n\nAn SDS Honors Thesis needs to focus on data in some non-trivial way. Previous SDS theses have accomplished this in various ways. A non-exhaustive list of examples would include:\n\nDevelopment focus: build an R package that interfaces with a rich data set and/or provides an interactive dashboard\nMethodology focus: learn about a sophisticated statistical methodology that is beyond the scope of the regular SDS curriculum and explain it and apply it in context\nApplication focus: investigate a real-world problem using sophisticated statistics and data science techniques and provide a nuanced analysis in context\nData focus: collect, curate, and/or document a novel data set using ethnographic techniques\n\n\nWhat characterizes an MST thesis?\n\nAn MST Honors Thesis is evaluated by members of both the Program in Statistical and Data Sciences and the Department of Mathematical Sciences and should have substantial mathematical and statistical content. This might look like:\n\nLearning about a sophisticated statistical methodology or area of statistical theory that is beyond the scope of the regular SDS/MST/MTH curriculum, explaining its theoretical basis and underpinnings, and applying it in context\nConducting a simulation study to evaluate how statistical methods perform in non-standard data contexts\n\n\nShould I do a Departmental Honors Thesis?\n\nIt depends. Please talk to your major adviser and your potential first reader.\nDepartmental Honors theses are generally most appropriate for students who have completed their major curriculum early, have previous research experience, and are very likely to pursue graduate school in the near future.\n\nFor students who want research experience: A departmental honors thesis is neither the best nor the only way to gain research experience. Departmental honors theses are independent solo projects (with faculty supervision) that must be completable within two semesters. This represents a narrow swath of what research can be. Joining a research lab is an alternative, and potentially better, way to explore collaborative research and to gain sustained (multi-year) research experience.\nFor students majoring in SDS with a second major: An honors thesis in the other major can count towards the application domain requirement for the SDS major. Application-focused theses are generally better situated in a second major (if there is one).\nFor students interested in graduate school: Many graduate degrees‚Äîand PhDs in particular‚Äîare research degrees and applicants are heavily evaluated on their research ability/promise. Co-authoring a peer-reviewed journal article with a faculty mentor is stronger and more visible sign of research ability than an honors thesis alone. Though some honors thesis projects may be turned into published articles with additional work post-graduation, multi-year work in a research lab is another, more direct path towards publication. Academically speaking, you may find that taking an advanced undergraduate or graduate-level class at UMass is a better investment of your time and can provide better academic preparation than a thesis. For those considering graduate degrees in (bio)statistics, additional coursework in mathematics (particularly in real analysis and measure theory) is strongly recommended.\nFor students who just want Honors: It is true that Departmental Honors theses are the only mechanism Smith has for earning Departmental Honors. However, as noted above, there are often better mechanisms for enriching your academic experience at Smith.\n\n\nWhat should I do to prepare for a Departmental Honors Thesis?\nWhen should I start thinking about a Departmental Honors Thesis?\nWho should I ask to be my first and second reader?\n\nPlease review the Faculty Research Profiles and look for a good match. Please note that faculty have varying schedules and capacities for advising theses, and may or may not be available to serve as one of your readers.\n\nIs there a template?\n\nYes! Please use pioneerdown."

We‚Äôre working on an R package and a paper for changepoint detection algorithms.\nThe transition back in AY25 was fairly smooth. I enjoyed teaching SDS 270, 236, and the capstone (twice!). This summer I‚Äôm putting together a course on sports analytics (SDS 355) for the first time!\nOutside of work, I‚Äôm coaching my daughters‚Äô basketball and softball teams, and we got a dog (a miniature schnauzer-terrier mix) who likes to bark at other dogs.\n\n\nGillian Beltz-Mohrmann\nI am very excited to join the SDS Program (as well as the Physics Department) at Smith this Fall! I recently completed a postdoctoral research fellowship in the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing Group at Argonne National Laboratory. This semester I am looking forward to teaching SDS 271: Introduction to Data Science in Python, as well as SDS 291: Multiple Regression. I am thrilled to be joining the Smith and Northampton communities.\n\n\nShiya Cao\nYear 3‚Äôs reappointment dossier preparation and review process helped me engage in systematic and in-depth reflection on my research and teaching practices. I am committed to continuing the three research areas I have developed since I joined Smith: (1) disability inclusion research using quantitative methodology; (2) accessible design; and (3) integrating disability inclusion components into data science pedagogy. I am also dedicated to providing effective strategies to help students succeed in data science courses and implementing inclusive pedagogy.\nThis year, I moved projects in the three research areas forward. I currently have two journal papers out for review examining employment and healthcare issues respectively through quantitative intersectional analyses of population survey data. In March 2025, I was honored to be invited by my collaborator Keegan Kang at Bucknell University to attend their Distinguished Visting Professor program for a week. During the visit, we continued working on an applied study using random projection algorithms in the differential privacy context. I also gave a talk on Conducting Statistics and Data Science Research in the Disability Inclusion Field and built connections with faculty members in the Mathematics & Statistics Department. Further, my collaboration with Heather Rosenfeld from the Smith College Spatial Analysis Lab resulted in the Campus Accessibility Map version 1.0. A first-authored journal article derived from this project is under review. Additionally, my article on Data Visualizations for Blind and Visually Impaired Students (condensed version) was invited by ASA Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group and published at Amstat News JEDI Corner. I will present the preliminary results of my pedagogical project at USCOTS this summer. Furthermore, I engaged five Smithies Sarah Susnea ‚Äô25, Mehreen Merza ‚Äô25, Lucia Qin ‚Äô26, Kayla Tillmon ‚Äô27, and Rae Traver-Fallick ‚Äô27 in a couple of research projects this year.\nI taught two sections of SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science in Fall 2024, had a Picker course release in Spring 2025 and taught SDS 100: Reproducible Scientific Computing with Data. I will be on sabbatical in Fall 2025 and will be looking forward to coming back in Spring 2026 to reflect on students‚Äô feedback and the challenges and opportunities of AI in higher education, and ‚Äúrestart‚Äù to support students‚Äô learning more effectively.\nOutside of work, a new thing I have been participating in this summer is a series of Thursday evening hiking events in Western Massachusetts.\n\n\nKaitlyn Cook\nThis past academic year I enjoyed teaching SDS 291: Multiple Regression and SDS 220: Introduction to Probability and Statistics, as well as supervising several super-star honors thesis students on projects related to statistical methods for taxonomy assignment (Elm Markert ‚Äô25) and misclassified interval-censored data (Skyler Williams ‚Äô25).\nOutside of the classroom, I‚Äôve continued settling into life in the Valley by joining a local run club in Northampton, playing trumpet with the Amherst Community Band, and watching far too much reality TV from my couch. My biggest reality TV accomplishment to date is watching the entirety of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City in under three weeks; recommendations for my next Real Housewives franchise are highly welcomed and encouraged.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nMy transition back to work after my 2022-2023 parental leave was smooth‚Äìalthough I jumped right into a three year term chairing SDS! Learning how to chair while being a working parent these past two years has been challenging, but rewarding. I also turned 40 last November, so I am also learning how to be middle-aged lol!\nThese past two years I taught SDS 290 Research Design and Analysis in SDS along with my course release for chairing. In psychology I taught PSY 202 Research Methods, PSY/SDS 364 Research Seminar in Intergroup Relationships twice, and in Spring 2025 I taught a brand new course, PSY 274 Close Relationships, which I will teach again in Spring 2026. It was a lot of fun and included topics such as communication; sexual intimacy; conflict and infidelity; and relationships across the lifespan. I am excited to teach PSY 202 again in Fall 2025 and then SDS 100 for the first time in Spring 2026!\nMy research has also progressed since my return. I began collaborations with Sarah Witkowski and Stephanie Jones in the Exercise and Sport Studies department here at Smith. Prof Witkowski‚Äôs work investigates on perimenopause symptoms, activity, and cardiovascular health while Prof Jones studies multiple sclerosis, somatosensory impairments, and fatigue. I have also begun a collaboration with Maya Rosen, Smith neuroscience professor, and Lizeth Sepulveda ‚Äô26 investigating childhood executive functioning as a buffer against declines in mental health due to COVID-19 stressors. I have also continued working on research in my lab, wrapping up papers on the division of household labor, gatekeeping, and social dominance orientation with Meredith Zhang ‚Äô23, as well as a paper on self-objectification in online learning contexts with Jessica Pardim Araujo ‚Äô23. Last spring I had four Smith students in my research group, three are current SDS students Kayla Tillmon ‚Äô27, Nora Zhou ‚Äô26J, and Itzel Aleman Flores ‚Äô27. I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing my research in the fall!\n\n\nWill Hopper\nI can‚Äôt believe the 2024-25 school year was my fifth year teaching at Smith! It‚Äôs seems to have gone by so fast, but I feel like I‚Äôm finally settling in. During the past year, I got to teach SDS 100: Reproducible Computing with Data for the first time. After helping to design the course several years ago, it was a reward to finally put the ideas into practice in the classroom, and I love seeing programming and data science concepts ‚Äúclick‚Äù for new students for the first time. I also taught SDS 270 (Programming for Data Science), and experimented with some changes to the format of the class to make it more interactive. One of the biggest changes was swapping out some assignments and tests for coding interviews, which gave me a chance to assess students in a more holistic way and understand what students are taking away from the class through conversation.\nOne small but exciting change from routine that I‚Äôm excited about is our department‚Äôs new course, SDS 210: Introduction to Statistics. SDS 210 is not really a new class, but replaces our department‚Äôs other two introductory statistics courses (SDS 201 and SDS 220), which had grown so similar over time that having two differently named and numbered classes no longer served a clear purpose. I‚Äôll be be ‚Äúinaugurating‚Äù SDS 210 in the upcoming Fall semester. I wanted to number the class SDS 210.5 (the average of 201 and 220) but the Registrar‚Äôs office would probably have not appreciated my little statistics joke.\nOver the summer, I‚Äôve once again been teaching statistics and data science courses in Smith‚Äôs Doctoral Program for Social Work, helping prepare their students for doing quantitative research as part of their doctoral thesis. I doubt the social work students suspected they‚Äôd be programming in R when they arrived to graduate school, but it just goes to show the incredible reach of statistics and data science into nearly every academic discipline out there!\n\n\nAlbert Y. Kim\n\n\nKatherine M. Kinnaird\n\n\nRebecca Kurtz-Garcia\n\n\nScott LaCombe\nThe last year has been one of many big and exciting changes! Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break. I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke. I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I‚Äôm excited to be back.\nMy sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students. My State Politics Lab has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April. We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans.\nThis upcoming year, I will be teaching my Research Seminar in Political Networks (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching Research Design and Analysis (SDS 290) and Introduction to American Politics (GOV 200) in the Spring.\n\n\nJericho Lawson\nHi everyone! I‚Äôm so excited to join the SDS department for the upcoming school year! The past year has been hectic to say the least. I just wrapped up PhD work at the University of California, Riverside, and while I am truly relieved to have finished, the feeling is definitely bittersweet. There were definitely many long nights of studying, fun moments with colleagues and friends, and lots of dry-erase markers thrown out from writing continuously on a whiteboard.\nI am ready to join the Smith community and cannot wait to teach y‚Äôall during the school year. I am delighted to teach SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science and SDS 270: Programming for Data Science in R this year. As I‚Äôm preparing to settle in, I‚Äôm slowly creating a list of restaurants and hiking spots in the area to explore; if you have any recommendations, let me know!\n\n\nAb Mosca ‚Äô14\n\n\nKatherine Clemans\n\n\nLindsay Poirier\nHello SDS friends! This year marked my fourth year at Smith, and the first time in my career that I was able to witness students that I taught in their first year of college walk across a stage at commencement. It was both a thrilling and emotional experience for me!\nThis year, I‚Äôve advanced work on a number of research projects - both long-term and more recent. Drawing on my ethnographic research into open government datasets, I published a paper in Big Data and Society detailing how data stakeholders weaponize calls to ‚Äúput data into context‚Äù in order to exert control over how the data gets interpreted. I also published a paper in Economic Anthropology based on fieldwork I have done at corporate data compliance conferences over the past two summers; the paper details how professionals at life science companies have developed strategies to creatively comply with public transparency and data reporting laws, while also mitigating risk to their reputations. Rounding out almost a decade of historical and ethnographic research into AI‚Äôs knowledge representation community, I published an article detailing historical controversies between AI‚Äôs ‚Äòneats‚Äô and ‚Äòscruffies‚Äô in the IEEE Annals for the History of Computing. Perhaps the article I‚Äôm most excited to report on however, was co-published in the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency with two Senior Smith students - Juniper Huang (‚Äô25) and Casey MacGibbon (‚Äô25). This paper shows how data analysts can produce ‚Äúdevious‚Äù data visualizations - drawing out events reported in data that are impossible or highly unlikely in order to encourage an audience to question the social conditions of the data‚Äôs production.\nI taught SDS 237: Data Ethnography in both the Fall and Spring semesters. I continue to be amazed by how much I learn from students each semester as they report on their interviews with data professionals, their observations of data collection practices, and their analyses of data discourse. I had a chance to present on how I teach this course as part of data ethics education panels at JSM and the Canadian Math Society meeting in 2024, and I also delivered a few guest lectures on the contents of this course throughout the academic year. In the Spring I taught SDS 238: Community-Based Data Science for the first time. The 19 students in the course helped the Northampton-based non-profit organization Solidago produce over 40 data visualizations documenting their history of progressive global justice grant-making. They also produced an archive of interviews with key organizational stakeholders. Overall, I was so impressed with the students‚Äô tremendous ability to apply design justice principles to addressing a community-based data science problem.\nOutside of academic life, I‚Äôve been continuing to work on improving my French, and I‚Äôve been relaxing with a number of meditative sewing and knitting projects. I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs in store in the coming year!\n\n\nNikko Stevens\n\n\nKementari Whitcher"

    "text": "Document won‚Äôt knit\nThere could be many reasons for this. Usually, the error message will pinpoint the location of the problem. Read the error messages!!\nSome most common problems are:\n\nincluding output in your code chunks, like\n\n\n\nError in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:1:27: unexpected numeric constant\n1: mean(~speed, data = cars) 169.683\n                              ^\n\n\n\nincluding the &gt; or + prompts that come from the console in your code chunks, like\n\n\n\nError in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:1:1: unexpected '&gt;'\n1: &gt;\n    ^\n\n\nor\n\n\nError: object 'speed' not found\n\n\n\nAsking R to print out an entire data set. This one is often tricky to spot, because the code will work fine in the console, saying something like [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 18684 rows ], but in the RMarkdown it will try to include everything and then run out of memory. The easiest way to spot this is if you have included\n\nin your document, but also dplyr expressions that aren‚Äôt saved into an object can do it, like\n\nNot including all the packages you need for your code. This error will occur if you try to use a function in a package that you haven‚Äôt loaded previously in your Markdown document.\n\n\n\n[1] \"2025-08-11 13:00:00 UTC\"\n\n\n[1] \"2025-08-11 13:00:00 UTC\"\n\n\nFor SDS classes, you often need to include\nNote that tidyverse in turn loads dplyr and ggplot2.\nNote also that require() and library() are equivalent for our purposes, but library() is preferred.\n\nPackages not installed. If you try to load a package that is not available in your R session, then you will get a warning.\n\n\n\nError in library(imadethisup): there is no package called 'imadethisup'\n\n\nTo install the package, click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button under the ‚ÄúPackages‚Äù tab, or use the install.packages() function.\n\nHaving spaces or other non-safe characters in filenames. This will often break when you try to compile your Markown document into HTML. Do not use spaces, slashes, or pound signs in filenames!!\nReferring to objects that don‚Äôt exist. Recall that your Markdown document knits in a clean R session!! Objects in your working environment are shown under the ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù tab in your RStudio window. However, when you knit your Markdown document, it launches in a new, completely different R session. In order to objects to be available in that session, you have to create them. If you see an error like:\n\n\n\nError: object 'my_object' not found\n\n\nit means that R cannot find any object in its environment called my_object. Make sure that my_object is created in the Markdown document prior to where you are trying to access it.\nOne common way this can occur is if you failed to load a data frame provided by a package (that doesn‚Äôt use lazy loading). For example, the oilabs package does not support lazy loading, so you have to use the data() command to bring the data frames into your environment before using them.\n\nIncorrect file path. Note that absolute filenames like\n\n\n\nWarning in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open file\n'/home/bbaumer/sds220/data/my_data.csv': No such file or directory\n\n\nError in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n\n\nwill not work on anyone else‚Äôs computer. It is usually better to use a relative file path like:\nHowever this will only works if someone else has the same directory structure as you. Note also that the working directory of the R session in which your Markdown document knits is not necessarily the same as the working directory of the R session which you see in RStudio. Thus, if\ndoesn‚Äôt work, you may have to try\nor something along those lines."

I earned my M.S. and Ph.D.¬†in applied mathematics from University of Connecticut. Since then, I‚Äôve taught at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Colby College.\nI have been working on statistical learning theory, in particular, nonparametric curve estimation and the probability theory related to it. I have studied the aysmptotic properties of density estimators. I‚Äôve become more interested in applying big data analytics to finance. Currently I‚Äôm working on credit scoring using survival analysis and other machine learning techniques.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\nIt was fun to reprise my Introduction to Probability and Statistics and Multiple Regression courses last year, but I am looking forward to expanding my course offerings this year. I‚Äôll be taking over Jordan Crouser‚Äôs Communicating with Data course in the fall, and creating a Data Journalism course for the spring. My personal goal for the SDS program is for us to have connections with every division on campus, and I‚Äôm particularly interested in crossover with the humanities. After a crazy summer of travel last year, I did my best to stay put this summer, which has allowed me to focus more on my research.\n\n\nMiles Ott\nMiles Ott is a new faculty member joining SDS in the Fall. He is interested in the statistical analysis of social network data and public health. This summer he gave a talk titled ‚ÄúStrategic Players for Identifying Optimal Social Network Intervention Subjects, with Application to an Undergraduate Social Network‚Äù at the Sunbelt Social Network conference in Beijing. He is excited to be a part of the SDS program and is looking forward to teaching 220 in September, and involving Smith students in his research.

I started a local chapter in Columbus and hoping to start one in Sarasota. Feel free to contact me if you need help finding/starting a local chapter in your own city.\nMaja Miloslavjevic ‚Äô14: I moved to Seattle 5 months ago and now work at Microsoft as a Program Manager in Office365! I love the quick-paced nature of Microsoft and that I get to drive direct customer impact with my work. Outside of work, I spend my time trying to enjoy as much of the Seattle summer as possible before the months of rain begin again‚Ä¶\nJingyang (Judy) Zhang ‚Äô14: I am still working for ITS at Smith, currently working on the college‚Äôs website.\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: I made it through year two in the Statistics PhD program at UC Berkeley and finished the Data Sciences for the 21st Century: Environment and Society program. I am currently back at NIST for the summer working on greenhouse gas monitoring data collected via small aircraft. In the fall I will be focusing on helping to teach a new class on writing for statistics and transitioning to research with a project to try to use citizen science data to better understand species distribution changes over space and time.\nLiz Stuart ‚Äô97 is a Professor of Mental Health, Biostatistics, and Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She won the 2017 Gertrude Cox Award, given out by the Washington Statistical Society and RTI to recognize an early to mid-career statistician who has made significant contributions to applied statistics.

I manage all of the data for the Department and am working with Python, R Studio, SQL, STATA, and SPSS everyday. I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of switching between languages and so appreciate that I still have my notes from Smith in addition to Google :) Each day, I am working on large clinical data sets for manuscript preparation in hopes of targeting our neuropsychological treatments to better serve our patients. In December, I was selected as the Smith Alumnae Admissions Coordinator for Maryland and Delaware - which means I coordinate all student interviews, lead a team of admissions volunteers, and host all of our accepted and admitted student parties. It is a packed job, but I love every moment of it!\nChrista Chiao ‚Äô15: I recently started working at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a Regional Targeting Director for the 2018 mid-term elections. I am really excited to combine my statistics and coding skills with some political know-how. The technical skills I‚Äôm using most in this job are R, SQL, Bash, GIS, and Python. Last year, I worked as a Deputy Analytics Director in Ohio for the Hillary campaign and as an Analytics Fellow at the Analyst Institute, a political analytics firm that helps campaigns measure the impact of their voter-contact programs. In my spare time, I row with Potomac Boat Club and think about acquiring some hobbies. I am so incredibly envious of the students that get to take part in this Data Science major! If anyone wants to learn more about getting into the (strictly) progressive data world, please let me know."

    "text": "Faculty Updates\nIt was a busy year in terms of faculty hiring.\n\nDavid Rockoff will be a MassMutual Faculty Fellow for 2018-2019. David finished his Ph.D.¬†in statistics at the University of Arizona in the spring and just arrived in Northampton. He will be teaching introductory statistics.\nJennifer Smetzer is our new lab instructor. Jenny received her Ph.D.¬†in Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology in 2017 at UMass. She is jointly appointed in SDS and Psychology, and will be teaching the labs for SDS 220 and SDS 201.\nAlbert Y. Kim and Katherine Kinnaird, both of whom were hired last year, have arrived at Smith and are now full-time tenure-track faculty. Albert‚Äôs position is fully in SDS, while Katie‚Äôs position is joint with computer science.\nOur program, director Joe O‚ÄôRourke, became the interim Provost when Katherine Rowe left Smith to become the president of William and Mary. Katherine was a champion of SDS, a fact mentioned in many articles about her time at Smith. Peter de Villiers of Psychology will serve as SDS chair in 2018-2019.\nBen Capistrant ‚Äì who taught in SDS this year ‚Äì is staying at Smith after accepting a tenure-track position in the School for Social Work. Ben will continue to teach two courses in SDS for at least the next three years. We are really happy to keep him in the fold!\nWe were awarded a tenure-track, joint position with Government for next year. The hiring process is already underway. Please steer any qualified candidates our way!\n\n\nBen Baumer\nI‚Äôm looking forward to my first ever sabbatical in the fall of 2018. This year I taught the capstone course for the first time, brought 156 students through introduction to data science (SDS 192), and had two noteworthy papers accepted: ‚ÄúA Grammar for Reproducible and Painless Extract-Transform-Load Operations on Medium Data‚Äù is going to the Journal of Computational and Statistical Graphics, and ‚ÄúHow often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding randomness in North American sport‚Äù is going to the Annals of Applied Statistics.\n\n\nR. Jordan Crouser\nJordan Crouser has just completed his first year as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and is pleased to maintain a courtesy appointment in SDS. His debut thesis student Ji Young Yun ‚Äô18 successfully defended the first human-computer interaction thesis in the history of the department, entitled ‚ÄúDiagnosisChecker: an Interactive Interface for Mitigating Diagnostic Bias in Mental Health Care‚Äù. Thank you Prof.¬†Randi Garcia for serving as the second reader for this project! This summer, he has 7 SURF students working in the Human Computation and Visualization Lab.\n\n\nRandi Garcia\nIn my second year at Smith I developed a new 300-level research course, SDS/PSY 364 Research Seminar in Intergroup Relationships. In this course students learned about the psychology of dyadic and group relationships as well as how to statistically model dependency in data that violates the independence assumption. I also taught MTH/SDS 290, Research Design and Analysis, for this first time. Students in 290 conducted experiments in collaboration with the Smith Botanic Gardens with help from a curriculum enhancement grant. To top off a great year of teaching, at this year‚Äôs Rally Day, I proudly (and nervously) received the SGA‚Äôs junior faculty teaching award!\nThis year I published research articles in Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, And Practice, Sexual and Relationship Therapy: Special Issue on Shining Light into the Darkness: Bisexuality and Relationships, and in Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. I presented research at the National Council for Family Relations‚Äô annual meeting and at UMass Amherst‚Äôs Social Psychology lunchtime brown bag.\n\n\nKatherine Halvorsen\nI have been on sabbatical this year, and I devoted much of the fall to helping my husband clean out and fix up his farm in Connecticut. His family had lived on the farm since 1910. While cleaning out the house and barn, we discovered a lot of family history through old pictures and interesting objects. We sold the farm in January to a family with five girls who we hope will enjoy the place as much as we have.\nI intended my project for the spring to be revising the math stat course, and a great opportunity came along when three students who needed to take the course could not travel to Mount Holyoke to take it there. I volunteered to teach a seminar in math stat and through that teaching learned how I want to change the course for the next time I teach it.\nIn January, I was invited to become a ‚ÄúDistinguished Visiting Professor of Statistics‚Äù at Middlebury College for the 2018-19 academic year. I suspect I will be temporarily filling the place Albert Kim left when Smith hired him to start teaching with us next fall! I will teach two applied statistics courses and do statistical consulting while I am at Middlebury, and I will see all of you when I return in the fall of 2019. Please make sure to look for Albert and welcome him to Smith when you return in the fall.\n\n\nLu Lu\nI just finished my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Smith. I am glad to have the opportunity of teaching Multiple Regression in Spring. In the summer, I‚Äôm attending local talks and conferences related to data science in finance and preparing for a two-day course in this field for MassMutual. I‚Äôm also doing research on modeling equity data and quantitative trading strategies.\n\n\nAmelia McNamara\nAfter three great years teaching at Smith, I‚Äôm moving to the University of St Thomas, in St Paul, MN. I‚Äôm joining the Department of Computer & Information Sciences, but I‚Äôll still be teaching statistics, and helping them develop their data analytics program. I‚Äôm really going to miss all the Smithies and the fantastic SDS program. However, I grew up in Minnesota and am excited to be back closer to my family and friends. My new email address is amelia.mcnamara@stthomas.edu Please stay in touch!\n\n\nMiles Ott\nIt was an eventful first year: I got to teach Intro Probability and Statistics both semesters, took part in my first five college datafest, and am all set up with a whopping 12 potted plants in my office. This summer I am looking forward to working with two SURF students to analyze a social network data set to better understand how one‚Äôs position in a social network is related to certain demographic characteristics and health behaviors. I will be presenting on some new research extending Generalized Estimating Equations to the network context at JSM in Vancouver, I hope to see many other Smithies there. I also will be speaking at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) at Brown University in August at a workshop on ‚ÄúBuilding Community in the Foundations of Data Science‚Äù, which sounds like my kind of fun! In the fall I am looking forward to to teaching a class on statistical analysis of social networks and welcoming Bert Kim, Jenny Smetzer, and Katie Kinnaird to SDS!"

Right now I am working on a project looking at early iron deficiency and the relationship to attention issues later in childhood. We have folks coming in for blood draws, MRIs, and neuropsychological testing of attention. We are about to analyze some preliminary data, which I am pumped to get started! We have our eye on a few conferences coming up to submit our results. I am also working on a cancer survivorship study looking at the transition back to school and where support lacks especially when it comes to neuropsychological evaluation of being ready to go back to school after cancer treatment. I am also working on a study exploring a phenomenon called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo and trying to figure out how exactly these kiddos are slower and in what capacity. Exciting news from my department - we were just in the New York Times! My department chair, Dr.¬†Mark Mahone, was interviewed for NBC nightly news about a study I have worked on evaluating the brains of preschoolers with ADHD and how they are different from those without ADHD and from their younger selves. The article is called ‚ÄúScans Show Differences in Brains of Preschoolers With ADHD.‚Äù\nIn other news, my husband and I welcomed our identical twin boys, Owen (6lbs 14oz) and Timothy (7lbs 2oz), in January! They are bundles of fun cooing and giggling like wild. It has been such a joyful six months so far! Here are some pictures with Owen on the left:\nSara Stoudt ‚Äô15: I finished year three of the PhD (ah!) and am making progress on a project on species distribution and abundance modeling and a book on Prof.¬†Deb Nolan and my experience teaching a writing class for statisticians. For the summer I‚Äôm interning at the Farmers Business Network (a startup that crowdsources farmer data to help them making planting, buying, and selling decisions), my first taste of industry!\nLiz Stuart ‚Äô97: I guess if you‚Äôre looking for things you can say that I had a blast coming back to give the The Dorothy Wrinch Lecture in Biomathematics at the Women in Mathematics in New England Conference in September 2017, and that I especially appreciated the efforts to find childcare for my 6 year old so I could attend and present!\nMaria Terres ‚Äô09: I‚Äôm currently a Senior Quantitative Researcher at The Climate Corporation, and this summer I‚Äôm mentoring my first intern! Last October I presented my work in precision agriculture at the Women in Statistics and Data Science conference in La Jolla, CA - it was great to see a lot of other Smithies there! This summer I‚Äôll be at JSM presenting some of my postdoc work in Bayesian spectral modeling for spatial processes. I‚Äôm also Treasurer for the ENVR section, so I encourage you all to attend our mixer! On a more personal note, my daughter Ottavia was born in January. Those of you attending JSM may get a chance to meet her.\nIf there are any other Bay Area Smithies out there, please feel free to get in touch; a couple of us have been meeting for brunch from time to time, and it would be fun to have a bigger group!\nJingyang (Judy) Zhang ‚Äô14: Happy Summer! I have been admitted by the Northwestern phd program in Statistics and will be attending this fall."
