Hola, buenas días!

I'm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical in Medellín, Colombia!
It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal. 
My wife and I took many Spanish classes at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), which is a lovely place to study. 
We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the [CEFR framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages). 
I suppose it's bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish! 

While on sabbatical I was able to complete the [3rd edition of *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/), and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT. 
We're working on [an R package](https://github.com/beanumber/tidychangepoint/) and [a paper](https://beanumber.github.io/changepoint-paper/) for changepoint detection algorithms.

My second year at Smith is in the books. I continued to work with students in my [Disability Inclusion Analytics Lab (DIAL)](https://scao53.github.io/). I took two Smithies **Christy Yang ’25J** and **Vicky Xu ’26** to attend the *Women in Statistics and Data Science (WSDS) Conference* in Bellevue, WA in Fall 2023. I am proud of our accomplishments so far:

In addition, I built new collaborations with other scholars this year. I have been working with Heather Rosenfeld from the Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL) at Smith on a research project named Mapping for Access on the Smith College Campus: A Participatory Mapping Approach. I have also been collaborating with Keegan Kang, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Bucknell University, on a research project named Model Interpretation after Using Random Projections: An Applied Study on Travel Disability Data. 

Moreover, I am working on publishing my doctoral dissertation, examining information systems-enabled workplace inclusion for disabled employees. One of my dissertation papers is [published](https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor220716) at the peer-reviewed journal *Work: A Journal of Prevention, Assessment & Rehabilitation*. I also gave a Sigma Xi talk at Smith in Fall 2023 and another talk for a Statistics II course at Bucknell University in Spring 2024. 

This year, I continued to teach SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science. In Fall 2023, I developed and taught a research seminar course SDS 300: Disability Inclusion and Data Analytics. In Spring 2024, I taught the senior capstone course SDS 410 and participated in the pedagogical partnerships program with my student pedagogical partner **My My Tran ’24**. I had great experiences teaching these courses. 

When I had free time, I enjoyed reading books with my book club, practicing piano, seeing movies at Amherst Cinema, and visiting museums. Also, thank you to my colleague Kaitlyn Cook for recommending me the classic American reality TV show “Survivor”! I began to watch Season 1 last summer and am currently at Season 24 (only skipped Seasons 5, 21, and 23), which is a nice way to decompress:)


#### Kaitlyn Cook

This past year I was excited to develop and teach a new statistics depth course on statistical methods in biostatistics and epidemiology (aptly named "Methods in Biostatistics and Epidemiology"!). The course blended topics from categorical data analysis and survival analysis with discussions of epidemiological study designs, threats to internal and external study validity, and metrics for quantifying the presence of disease in populations. I also enjoyed teaching MTH 246: Probability for the second time and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. Finally, I was particularly proud to watch my inaugural thesis student, **Heng (Silvia) Song '24**, successfully defend her thesis on "Stochastic Processes and their Application in Bayesian Statistics", making her the first student to graduate with honors in Mathematical Statistics at Smith! Outside of the classroom, I've continued settling into life in the Valley by joining a local run club in Northampton, playing trumpet with the Amherst Community Band, and watching far too much reality TV from my couch.

The last year has been one of many big and exciting changes! Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break. I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke. I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I'm excited to be back.

My sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students. [My State Politics Lab](https://www.smith.edu/academics/our-approach-learning/humanities#state-politics-lab-8) has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April. We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans. 

This upcoming year, I will be teaching my *Research Seminar in Political Networks* (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching *Research Design and Analysis* (SDS 290) and *Introduction to American Politics* (GOV 200) in the Spring. 


#### [Lindsay Poirier](https://lindsaypoirier.github.io/)

Hello SDS friends! This summer, I'm feeling so grateful that I'm coming off of a year where I had an opportunity to focus on work that I find both socially important and personally fulfilling. A Spring sabbatical provided me time to really submerge into aspects of my research program. This past February I spent a month in Frankfurt, Germany on a Mercator Fellowship at Goethe University. While I was there, I delivered a number of lectures and workshops on "data ethnography" and had a chance to work with faculty, post-docs, and graduate students brainstorming how to devise new methods for studying the cultural aspects of data production, circulation, and use. Then in March, with some tremendous collaborators at UCLA, Northeastern University, and Whitman College, I published [a paper](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307571) in the *American Journal of Public Health* documenting that almost half of US carceral facilities are proximate to sites of contamination by "forever chemicals" (or PFAS). The paper was covered in *[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4547224-forever-chemicals-pfas-us-prisons-drinking-water-dangerous-levels-study/)*, *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/08/prisons-contaminated-water-pfas)*, and supported the development of [proposed US legislation](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-rep-pressley-introduce-environmental-health-in-prisons-act) for improving environmental health in prisons. Publishing this paper meant a lot to me, both personally and professionally. Sabbatical also granted me some time for more personal pursuits. I've been diligently working to improve my French, devising Massachusetts adventures for me and my 2.5-year old niece, and putting some elbow grease into making my new house in South Hadley feel more like a home. 

This coming year, I'm looking forward to continuing my research examining the cultural origins of the [Open Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) database - anthropologically studying how the professionals responsible for disclosing data about their payments to healthcare providers develop certain accounting and meaning-making strategies in their work. I look forward to continue teaching *Data Ethnography* in the Fall and Spring, and to offering a new course called *Community-Based Data Science* in the Spring.
