#### [Ben Baumer](https://beanumber.github.io/)

Hola, buenas días!

I'm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical (AY24) in Medellín, Colombia!
It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal.
My wife and I took many Spanish classes at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), which is a lovely place to study.
We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the [CEFR framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages).
I suppose it's bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish!

While on sabbatical I was able to complete the [3rd edition of *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/), and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT.
We're working on [an R package](https://github.com/beanumber/tidychangepoint/) and [a paper](https://beanumber.github.io/changepoint-paper/) for changepoint detection algorithms.

The transition back in AY25 was fairly smooth.
I enjoyed teaching SDS 270, 236, and the capstone (twice!).
This summer I'm putting together a course on sports analytics (SDS 355) for the first time!

Outside of work, I'm coaching my daughters' basketball and softball teams, and we got a dog (a miniature schnauzer-terrier mix) who likes to bark at other dogs.

#### [Gillian Beltz-Mohrmann](https://gbeltzmo.github.io/)

I am very excited to join the SDS Program (as well as the Physics Department) at Smith this Fall!
I recently completed a postdoctoral research fellowship in the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing Group at Argonne National Laboratory.
This semester I am looking forward to teaching SDS 271: Introduction to Data Science in Python, as well as SDS 291: Multiple Regression.
I am thrilled to be joining the Smith and Northampton communities.

#### [Shiya Cao](https://scao53.github.io/)

Year 3’s reappointment dossier preparation and review process helped me engage in systematic and in-depth reflection on my research and teaching practices.
I am committed to continuing the three research areas I have developed since I joined Smith: (1) disability inclusion research using quantitative methodology; (2) accessible design; and (3) integrating disability inclusion components into data science pedagogy.
I am also dedicated to providing effective strategies to help students succeed in data science courses and implementing inclusive pedagogy.

This year, I moved projects in the three research areas forward.
I currently have two journal papers out for review examining employment and healthcare issues respectively through quantitative intersectional analyses of population survey data.
In March 2025, I was honored to be invited by my collaborator Keegan Kang at Bucknell University to attend their Distinguished Visting Professor program for a week.
During the visit, we continued working on an applied study using random projection algorithms in the differential privacy context.
I also gave a talk on Conducting Statistics and Data Science Research in the Disability Inclusion Field and built connections with faculty members in the Mathematics & Statistics Department.
Further, my collaboration with Heather Rosenfeld from the Smith College Spatial Analysis Lab resulted in the Campus Accessibility Map [version 1.0](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2de16261292f4581be25daee49958bf5).
A first-authored journal article derived from this project is under review.
Additionally, my article on Data Visualizations for Blind and Visually Impaired Students (condensed version) was invited by ASA Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group and [published](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2024/10/01/data-visualizations-accessible/) at *Amstat News JEDI Corner*.
I will present the preliminary results of my pedagogical project at USCOTS this summer.
Furthermore, I engaged five Smithies **Sarah Susnea ‘25**, **Mehreen Merza ‘25**, **Lucia Qin ‘26**, **Kayla Tillmon ‘27**, and **Rae Traver-Fallick ’27** in a couple of research projects this year.

I taught two sections of *SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science* in Fall 2024, had a Picker course release in Spring 2025 and taught *SDS 100: Reproducible Scientific Computing with Data*.
I will be on sabbatical in Fall 2025 and will be looking forward to coming back in Spring 2026 to reflect on students’ feedback and the challenges and opportunities of AI in higher education, and “restart” to support students’ learning more effectively.

Outside of work, a new thing I have been participating in this summer is [a series of Thursday evening hiking events in Western Massachusetts](https://www.ventureoutproject.com/queer-day-hikes-events).

#### [Kaitlyn Cook](https://www.smith.edu/people/kaitlyn-cook)

This past academic year I enjoyed teaching *SDS 291: Multiple Regression* and *SDS 220: Introduction to Probability and Statistics*, as well as supervising several super-star honors thesis students on projects related to statistical methods for taxonomy assignment (**Elm Markert '25**) and misclassified interval-censored data (**Skyler Williams '25**).

Outside of the classroom, I've continued settling into life in the Valley by joining a local run club in Northampton, playing trumpet with the Amherst Community Band, and watching far too much reality TV from my couch.
My biggest reality TV accomplishment to date is watching the entirety of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City in under three weeks; recommendations for my next Real Housewives franchise are highly welcomed and encouraged.

#### [Randi Garcia](https://www.randilgarcia.com/)

My transition back to work after my 2022-2023 parental leave was smooth--although I jumped right into a three year term chairing SDS!
Learning how to chair while being a working parent these past two years has been challenging, but rewarding.
I also turned 40 last November, so I am also learning how to be middle-aged lol!

These past two years I taught SDS 290 Research Design and Analysis in SDS along with my course release for chairing.
In psychology I taught PSY 202 Research Methods, PSY/SDS 364 Research Seminar in Intergroup Relationships twice, and in Spring 2025 I taught a brand new course, PSY 274 Close Relationships, which I will teach again in Spring 2026.
It was a lot of fun and included topics such as communication; sexual intimacy; conflict and infidelity; and relationships across the lifespan.
I am excited to teach PSY 202 again in Fall 2025 and then SDS 100 for the first time in Spring 2026!

My research has also progressed since my return.
I began collaborations with Sarah Witkowski and Stephanie Jones in the Exercise and Sport Studies department here at Smith.
Prof Witkowski's work investigates on perimenopause symptoms, activity, and cardiovascular health while Prof Jones studies multiple sclerosis, somatosensory impairments, and fatigue.
I have also begun a collaboration with Maya Rosen, Smith neuroscience professor, and Lizeth Sepulveda '26 investigating childhood executive functioning as a buffer against declines in mental health due to COVID-19 stressors.
I have also continued working on research in my lab, wrapping up papers on the division of household labor, gatekeeping, and social dominance orientation with Meredith Zhang '23, as well as a paper on self-objectification in online learning contexts with Jessica Pardim Araujo '23.
Last spring I had four Smith students in my research group, three are current SDS students Kayla Tillmon '27, Nora Zhou '26J, and Itzel Aleman Flores '27.
I'm looking forward to continuing my research in the fall!

#### Will Hopper

I can't believe the 2024-25 school year was my **fifth** year teaching at Smith!
It's seems to have gone by so fast, but I feel like I'm finally settling in.
During the past year, I got to teach [SDS 100: Reproducible Computing with Data](https://smithcollege-sds.github.io/sds100/){target="_blank"} for the first time.
After helping to design the course several years ago, it was a reward to finally put the ideas into practice in the classroom, and I love seeing programming and data science concepts "click" for new students for the first time.
I also taught SDS 270 (Programming for Data Science), and experimented with some changes to the format of the class to make it more interactive.
One of the biggest changes was swapping out some assignments and tests for coding interviews, which gave me a chance to assess students in a more holistic way and understand what students are taking away from the class through conversation.

One small but exciting change from routine that I'm excited about is our department's new course, SDS 210: Introduction to Statistics.
SDS 210 is not *really* a new class, but replaces our department's other two introductory statistics courses (SDS 201 and SDS 220), which had grown so similar over time that having two differently named and numbered classes no longer served a clear purpose.
I'll be be "inaugurating" SDS 210 in the upcoming Fall semester.
I *wanted* to number the class SDS 210.5 (the average of 201 and 220) but the Registrar's office would probably have not appreciated my little statistics joke.

Over the summer, I've once again been teaching statistics and data science courses in Smith's [Doctoral Program for Social Work](https://ssw.smith.edu/phd){target="_blank"}, helping prepare their students for doing quantitative research as part of their doctoral thesis.
I doubt the social work students suspected they'd be programming in R when they arrived to graduate school, but it just goes to show the incredible reach of statistics and data science into nearly every academic discipline out there!

#### [Scott LaCombe](https://www.scottlacombe.com)

The last year has been one of many big and exciting changes!
Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break.
I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke.
I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I'm excited to be back.

My sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students.
[My State Politics Lab](https://www.smith.edu/academics/our-approach-learning/humanities#state-politics-lab-8) has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April.
We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans.

This upcoming year, I will be teaching my *Research Seminar in Political Networks* (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching *Research Design and Analysis* (SDS 290) and *Introduction to American Politics* (GOV 200) in the Spring.

#### [Jericho Lawson](https://www.smith.edu/people/jericho-lawson)

Hi everyone! I'm so excited to join the SDS department for the upcoming school year! The past year has been hectic to say the least. I just wrapped up PhD work at the University of California, Riverside, and while I am truly relieved to have finished, the feeling is definitely bittersweet. There were definitely many long nights of studying, fun moments with colleagues and friends, and lots of dry-erase markers thrown out from writing continuously on a whiteboard. 

I am ready to join the Smith community and cannot wait to teach y'all during the school year. I am delighted to teach SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science and SDS 270: Programming for Data Science in R this year. As I'm preparing to settle in, I'm slowly creating a list of restaurants and hiking spots in the area to explore; if you have any recommendations, let me know!

Hello SDS friends!
This year marked my fourth year at Smith, and the first time in my career that I was able to witness students that I taught in their first year of college walk across a stage at commencement.
It was both a thrilling and emotional experience for me!

This year, I've advanced work on a number of research projects - both long-term and more recent.
Drawing on my ethnographic research into open government datasets, I [published](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517241270656) a paper in *Big Data and Society* detailing how data stakeholders weaponize calls to "put data into context" in order to exert control over how the data gets interpreted.
I also [published](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sea2.70010) a paper in *Economic Anthropology* based on fieldwork I have done at corporate data compliance conferences over the past two summers; the paper details how professionals at life science companies have developed strategies to creatively comply with public transparency and data reporting laws, while also mitigating risk to their reputations.
Rounding out almost a decade of historical and ethnographic research into AI's knowledge representation community, I [published](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/an/2025/02/10817130/231p8C3UACc) an article detailing historical controversies between AI's 'neats' and 'scruffies' in the *IEEE Annals for the History of Computing*.
Perhaps the article I'm most excited to report on however, was [co-published](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732114) in the *ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency* with two Senior Smith students - Juniper Huang ('25) and Casey MacGibbon ('25).
This paper shows how data analysts can produce "devious" data visualizations - drawing out events reported in data that are impossible or highly unlikely in order to encourage an audience to question the social conditions of the data's production.

I taught *SDS 237: Data Ethnography* in both the Fall and Spring semesters.
I continue to be amazed by how much I learn from students each semester as they report on their interviews with data professionals, their observations of data collection practices, and their analyses of data discourse.
I had a chance to present on how I teach this course as part of data ethics education panels at JSM and the Canadian Math Society meeting in 2024, and I also delivered a few guest lectures on the contents of this course throughout the academic year.
In the Spring I taught *SDS 238: Community-Based Data Science* for the first time.
The 19 students in the course helped the Northampton-based non-profit organization Solidago produce over 40 data visualizations documenting their history of progressive global justice grant-making.
They also produced an archive of interviews with key organizational stakeholders.
Overall, I was so impressed with the students' tremendous ability to apply design justice principles to addressing a community-based data science problem.

Outside of academic life, I've been continuing to work on improving my French, and I've been relaxing with a number of meditative sewing and knitting projects.
I'm looking forward to what's in store in the coming year!

## Alumni Updates

-   Alumni updates will be added HERE

-   Shevaughn Holness awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowship!!!

-   Maggie Carttar ‘20 — **2024 update.** This year I’ve started a new role at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in DC, a move into the brain of the US central bank system from the regional branch in Kansas City where I previously did similar work.
    As a part of Statistics and Data Management within Board IT I get to coordinate data collection and quality assessments for multiple banking reports related to financial industry regulation and monetary policy.
    I’ve been loving DC so far, roller skating, singing in a local choir, knitting many socks, and playing D&D with a bunch of fellow former Lamont pals every once in a blue moon.
    Hope y’all are doing so well!

-   Priscilla Wencong Li '18 - I will take a break from being a Data Scientist and start my MBA at Wharton this fall!

-   Zoe Meers ('17, SDS minor) - This year I recently started working as a data scientist at the World Bank, a perfect combination of my GOV & SDS Smith degree, where I'm currently building out data viz packages in Python for economists & data scientist across the Bank to use. I spent the past four years working in tech as a data scientist at Canva where we did lots of fun stuff like implementing a Bayesian A/B testing suite and other fun models like multi-armed bandits. I also open sourced R & Python packages for Flourish while working at Canva. I'm coming up on year 8 (!) of maintaining some R packages, including `ggparliament` for visualizing legislatures & election results and `readabs` for pulling & cleaning data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics -- time flies! I use the skills the SDS department taught me at work every day - my sincere thanks to such a wonderful & innovative department!
