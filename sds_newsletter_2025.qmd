#### [Ben Baumer](https://beanumber.github.io/)

Hola, buenas días!

I'm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical (AY24) in Medellín, Colombia!
It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal.
My wife and I took many Spanish classes at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), which is a lovely place to study.
We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the [CEFR framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages).
I suppose it's bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish!

While on sabbatical I was able to complete the [3rd edition of *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/), and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT.
We're working on [an R package](https://github.com/beanumber/tidychangepoint/) and [a paper](https://beanumber.github.io/changepoint-paper/) for changepoint detection algorithms.

The transition back in AY25 was fairly smooth.
I enjoyed teaching SDS 270, 236, and the capstone (twice!).
This summer I'm putting together a course on sports analytics (SDS 355) for the first time!

Outside of work, I'm coaching my daughters' basketball and softball teams, and we got a dog (a miniature schnauzer-terrier mix) who likes to bark at other dogs.

#### [Shiya Cao](https://scao53.github.io/)

Year 3’s reappointment dossier preparation and review process helped me engage in systematic and in-depth reflection on my research and teaching practices.
I am committed to continuing the three research areas I have developed since I joined Smith: (1) disability inclusion research using quantitative methodology; (2) accessible design; and (3) integrating disability inclusion components into data science pedagogy.
I am also dedicated to providing effective strategies to help students succeed in data science courses and implementing inclusive pedagogy.

This year, I moved projects in the three research areas forward.
I currently have two journal papers out for review examining employment and healthcare issues respectively through quantitative intersectional analyses of population survey data.
In March 2025, I was honored to be invited by my collaborator Keegan Kang at Bucknell University to attend their Distinguished Visting Professor program for a week.
During the visit, we continued working on an applied study using random projection algorithms in the differential privacy context.
I also gave a talk on Conducting Statistics and Data Science Research in the Disability Inclusion Field and built connections with faculty members in the Mathematics & Statistics Department.
Further, my collaboration with Heather Rosenfeld from the Smith College Spatial Analysis Lab resulted in the Campus Accessibility Map [version 1.0](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2de16261292f4581be25daee49958bf5).
A first-authored journal article derived from this project is under review.
Additionally, my article on Data Visualizations for Blind and Visually Impaired Students (condensed version) was invited by ASA Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Outreach Group and [published](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2024/10/01/data-visualizations-accessible/) at *Amstat News JEDI Corner*.
I will present the preliminary results of my pedagogical project at USCOTS this summer.
Furthermore, I engaged five Smithies **Sarah Susnea ‘25**, **Mehreen Merza ‘25**, **Lucia Qin ‘26**, **Kayla Tillmon ‘27**, and **Rae Traver-Fallick ’27** in a couple of research projects this year.

I taught two sections of *SDS 192: Introduction to Data Science* in Fall 2024, had a Picker course release in Spring 2025 and taught *SDS 100: Reproducible Scientific Computing with Data*.
I will be on sabbatical in Fall 2025 and will be looking forward to coming back in Spring 2026 to reflect on students’ feedback and the challenges and opportunities of AI in higher education, and “restart” to support students’ learning more effectively.

Outside of work, a new thing I have been participating in this summer is [a series of Thursday evening hiking events in Western Massachusetts](https://www.ventureoutproject.com/queer-day-hikes-events).

#### Kaitlyn Cook

This past year I was excited to develop and teach a new statistics depth course on statistical methods in biostatistics and epidemiology (aptly named "Methods in Biostatistics and Epidemiology"!).
The course blended topics from categorical data analysis and survival analysis with discussions of epidemiological study designs, threats to internal and external study validity, and metrics for quantifying the presence of disease in populations.
I also enjoyed teaching MTH 246: Probability for the second time and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time.
Finally, I was particularly proud to watch my inaugural thesis student, **Heng (Silvia) Song '24**, successfully defend her thesis on "Stochastic Processes and their Application in Bayesian Statistics", making her the first student to graduate with honors in Mathematical Statistics at Smith!
Outside of the classroom, I've continued settling into life in the Valley by joining a local run club in Northampton, playing trumpet with the Amherst Community Band, and watching far too much reality TV from my couch.

#### [Randi Garcia](https://www.randilgarcia.com/)

My transition back to work after my 2022-2023 parental leave was smooth--although I jumped right into a three year term chairing SDS!
Learning how to chair while being a working parent these past two years has been challenging, but rewarding.
I also turned 40 last November, so I am also learning how to be middle-aged lol!

These past two years I taught SDS 290 Research Design and Analysis in SDS along with my course release for chairing.
In psychology I taught PSY 202 Research Methods, PSY/SDS 364 Research Seminar in Intergroup Relationships twice, and in Spring 2025 I taught a brand new course, PSY 274 Close Relationships, which I will teach again in Spring 2026.
It was a lot of fun and included topics such as communication; sexual intimacy; conflict and infidelity; and relationships across the lifespan.
I am excited to teach PSY 202 again in Fall 2025 and then SDS 100 for the first time in Spring 2026!

My research has also progressed since my return.
I began collaborations with Sarah Witkowski and Stephanie Jones in the Exercise and Sport Studies department here at Smith.
Prof Witkowski's work investigates on perimenopause symptoms, activity, and cardiovascular health while Prof Jones studies multiple sclerosis, somatosensory impairments, and fatigue.
I have also begun a collaboration with Maya Rosen, Smith neuroscience professor, and Lizeth Sepulveda '26 investigating childhood executive functioning as a buffer against declines in mental health due to COVID-19 stressors.
I have also continued working on research in my lab, wrapping up papers on the division of household labor, gatekeeping, and social dominance orientation with Meredith Zhang '23, as well as a paper on self-objectification in online learning contexts with Jessica Pardim Araujo '23.
Last spring I had four Smith students in my research group, three are current SDS students Kayla Tillmon '27, Nora Zhou '26J, and Itzel Aleman Flores '27.
I'm looking forward to continuing my research in the fall!

#### Will Hopper

I can't believe the 2024-25 school year was my **fifth** year teaching at Smith!
It's seems to have gone by so fast, but I feel like I'm finally settling in.
During the past year, I got to teach [SDS 100: Reproducible Computing with Data](https://smithcollege-sds.github.io/sds100/){target="_blank"} for the first time.
After helping to design the course several years ago, it was a reward to finally put the ideas into practice in the classroom, and I love seeing programming and data science concepts "click" for new students for the first time.
I also taught SDS 270 (Programming for Data Science), and experimented with some changes to the format of the class to make it more interactive.
One of the biggest changes was swapping out some assignments and tests for coding interviews, which gave me a chance to assess students in a more holistic way and understand what students are taking away from the class through conversation.

One small but exciting change from routine that I'm excited about is our department's new course, SDS 210: Introduction to Statistics.
SDS 210 is not *really* a new class, but replaces our department's other two introductory statistics courses (SDS 201 and SDS 220), which had grown so similar over time that having two differently named and numbered classes no longer served a clear purpose.
I'll be be "inaugurating" SDS 210 in the upcoming Fall semester.
I *wanted* to number the class SDS 210.5 (the average of 201 and 220) but the Registrar's office would probably have not appreciated my little statistics joke.

Over the summer, I've once again been teaching statistics and data science courses in Smith's [Doctoral Program for Social Work](https://ssw.smith.edu/phd){target="_blank"}, helping prepare their students for doing quantitative research as part of their doctoral thesis.
I doubt the social work students suspected they'd be programming in R when they arrived to graduate school, but it just goes to show the incredible reach of statistics and data science into nearly every academic discipline out there!

The last year has been one of many big and exciting changes!
Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break.
I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke.
I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I'm excited to be back.

My sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students.
[My State Politics Lab](https://www.smith.edu/academics/our-approach-learning/humanities#state-politics-lab-8) has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April.
We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans.

This upcoming year, I will be teaching my *Research Seminar in Political Networks* (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching *Research Design and Analysis* (SDS 290) and *Introduction to American Politics* (GOV 200) in the Spring.

#### [Lindsay Poirier](https://lindsaypoirier.github.io/)

Hello SDS friends!
This summer, I'm feeling so grateful that I'm coming off of a year where I had an opportunity to focus on work that I find both socially important and personally fulfilling.
A Spring sabbatical provided me time to really submerge into aspects of my research program.
This past February I spent a month in Frankfurt, Germany on a Mercator Fellowship at Goethe University.
While I was there, I delivered a number of lectures and workshops on "data ethnography" and had a chance to work with faculty, post-docs, and graduate students brainstorming how to devise new methods for studying the cultural aspects of data production, circulation, and use.
Then in March, with some tremendous collaborators at UCLA, Northeastern University, and Whitman College, I published [a paper](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307571) in the *American Journal of Public Health* documenting that almost half of US carceral facilities are proximate to sites of contamination by "forever chemicals" (or PFAS).
The paper was covered in [*The Hill*](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4547224-forever-chemicals-pfas-us-prisons-drinking-water-dangerous-levels-study/), [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/08/prisons-contaminated-water-pfas), and supported the development of [proposed US legislation](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-rep-pressley-introduce-environmental-health-in-prisons-act) for improving environmental health in prisons.
Publishing this paper meant a lot to me, both personally and professionally.
Sabbatical also granted me some time for more personal pursuits.
I've been diligently working to improve my French, devising Massachusetts adventures for me and my 2.5-year old niece, and putting some elbow grease into making my new house in South Hadley feel more like a home.

This coming year, I'm looking forward to continuing my research examining the cultural origins of the [Open Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) database - anthropologically studying how the professionals responsible for disclosing data about their payments to healthcare providers develop certain accounting and meaning-making strategies in their work.
I look forward to continue teaching *Data Ethnography* in the Fall and Spring, and to offering a new course called *Community-Based Data Science* in the Spring.
