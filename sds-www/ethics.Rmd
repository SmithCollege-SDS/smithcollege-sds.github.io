### Supplementary materials

In our paper, *Integrating Data Science Ethics Into an Undergraduate Major: A Case Study* [@baumer2020integrating], we describe six ethics modules that can be incorporated into various classes. 
These modules are summarized in Table 1 of the paper, which is reproduced below. 
This table connects each module to the relevant categories as defined by @floridi2016what and the taxonomy of learning defined by @bloom1956taxonomy.
Hyperlinks will take you to the actual teaching material. 

```{r modules, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
