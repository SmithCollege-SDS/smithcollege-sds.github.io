Choose one of the following prompts and write an at most 2500-word [**essay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay) on data science ethics, technology, and society (in Markdown). In addition to the readings list above, expect to do some additional research relevant to your topic. This is *not* a reflection paper -- you should support your arguments with citations throughout.

#. Choose *one* episode from *Weapons of Math Destruction* and analyze it in the context of either the Data Values and Principles or the Hippocratic Oath for Data Science outlined by the National Academy of Sciences. Did the actors in this episode behave ethically? Explain why or why not by linking specific actions to specific ethical principles. Could this code of ethics prevent similar behavior in the future? 

#. Choose *one* episode from *Weapons of Math Destruction* and analyze it in the context of *both* the Western and Confucian principles ethical principles outlined by [Elliott, et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1307140).
